Last week , my girlfriend and I decided to renovate our basement . We wanted to make it look new and fresh . First , we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures , deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room . We then made a list of things we needed to buy at the store to accomplish this renovation . We came back home and began working in the basement . We worked together and removed certain things first . Then , we painted the basement walls together . Then , we hung pictures on the walls that we 'd bought . We then placed a few items like a couch and large TV that we 'd bought in the basement . We added our new carpets too . Finally , we put the popcorn machine in the corner of the basement and our basement looked new and fresh ! Our basement had been nicely renovated indeed !|Where did they go with the list?|The supermarket.|0

The sharp buzz of the washing machine timer distracted me from the television show flickering on the screen . I thought about ignoring it , but I had an early shift at the diner the next morning and my only pair of black pants were in the laundry load . I went down the steep stairs to the basement where the laundry room sat , out of the way . I opened the washer and sighed as I looked inside . I grabbed an armful of the clothes from the washer and tossed them into the dryer , than repeated the process until the washer was empty . Without much thought , I tossed in a dryer sheet and slammed the door . I checked the settings , adjusted a few , and heard the comforting hum of the dryer coming to life . Satisfied that I would be ready for work the next day , I returned up the stairs to my television show .|Where were the pants?|in the laundry load|1

I wanted to take a photograph of something natural . So I decided to go out side and see what I could take a picture of . After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later .|When did they decide whether or not to use the Flash?|After getting the whole tree in the picture|0

After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later .|What did they use if it was dark?|photo|0

After I finished university , I wanted to move out on my own . I waited a while and lived with my parents for a few months . I was n't too happy with that situation though because I wanted freedom , I wanted to be able to meet people , go out at night , lay on the couch and watch TV all day if that 's what I felt like doing .  I started dating my boyfriend and we had been together for almost six months when we made the decision to move in together .  All the apartments we saw were either terrible or beautiful but incredibly expensive . Eventually we found what that was beautiful , spacious and looked perfect for us and it was priced very well . So we took the leap and we decided to buy the flat .|What did they make?|a decision to move in together|1

Sometimes I really hate visiting the doctor . But at the same time I feel good because if anything is wrong with me the doctor will be able to help . When I think I 'm either sick or just to make sure I 'm healthy I make a doctor appointment . When it 's 20 minutes before it 's time for my appointment , I leave my house to go . Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park . I walk inside the doctor 's office and check in with the receptionist . Once they call my name I go straight to the scale to get weighed , I always hate this part . Then the nurse takes me to the room , takes my blood pressure and asks why I 'm there . I 'm only there to check my cholesterol since last time I had it checked it was high . The doctor then comes in to talk about my last results and says that we will check it again today and then call him back in 3 months if it 's high to talk about my options . After that is done I go to the check out window and pay my copay for my visit .|Where do they get blood drawn?|at the doctor's office|1

First I turned on the computer to insert my hard-drive into . I then connected the projector so that I could screen my presentation to my colleagues . Once I had the computer and projector up and running I pulled down the screen in which the projector would be projecting onto . I took two deep breaths and performed a quick practice run in my mind while double checking that all of my equipment was up to par and ready for my big presentation . I also handed out paper copies of my presentation to my colleagues so they could be familiar with it if need be for future references . Once I got all I needed passed out for my presentation , it was showtime and I felt 110 percent ready to tackle my presentation .|What did they need to follow along with?|colleagues|0

Our regular piano player was out sick and could n't play piano for the Sunday service . Another member of our church remembered that I use to play piano , and asked if I would be interested in filling in . I was really nervous . It had been a long time since I have played in front of people and I was n't sure if I knew the songs well . They gave me the music ahead of time and I went home and practiced . I spent a lot of time learning the new songs . Finally it was Sunday and I was really nervous . I was n't sure I would know when to start playing or if I would remember the right keys . I was n't nervous anymore and just started playing . I really enjoyed myself . Afterwards everyone was telling me I did a good job and the Pastor asked if I would be interested filling in again if they needed someone .|When did service start?|Sunday|1

Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring .

Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring .

When I cooked pasta last , I had a great experience . I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce . In order to do this , we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box . As we put the pasta in , we stirred it and watched the water boil . After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes , we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat . Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste , we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot . Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot , we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta .|When did the pasta taste amazing?|During the last time they cooked pasta|1

Yesterday was the first day of school for my children , Anna and Joseph . It was a beautiful warm , sunny morning so we decided to walk to school . After both Anna and Joseph had finished breakfast and dressed in their new school clothes , we walked out the front door of our house and started down the sidewalk toward Maple Grove Elementary .  It was a short walk through the neighborhood and we passed many of our friends and neighbors on the way .  Mr. Jones , the mail carrier , said " Good morning . Have a great first day ! " When we arrived across the street from the school , Mrs. Green , the Crossing Guard , said " Wait here please . "  She walked out into the street and held up her " STOP " sign to make it safe for us to cross .  Once we reached the other side of the street , we walked indoors and down the hall to Anna and Joseph 's classroom .|Who did he wish a good day?|he wished the crossing guard to have a good day|0

I ordered all large pizzas . 2 of them just plain cheese , 2 of them with beef and chicken -LRB- half and half -RRB- , 2 of them with jalapeno and green pepper . He repeated whole order for me and told me if I need to add anything else . I said no . He said thank you .|What did they call to order a pizza?|a Little Caesar's pizza restaurant|0

I approached the vending machine while pulling my wallet out of my back pocket . I stood in front of the machine and looked through the glass at all the choices in front of me . Did I want a bag of potato chips or a candy bar ? I decided I wanted a Reese 's peanut butter cups . I pulled two one dollar bills from wallet and placed them into the money slot and watched the machine grab and pull them inside . I saw that I now had $ 2.00 of credit . I pressed A7 on the keypad which was in front of the Reese 's peanut butter cups . I watched it drop down to bottom of the machine . I pushed the wide door open and grabbed my candy bar . I heard two quarters fall into the coin return slot .|What did they watch rotate?|chips|0

When I came home from work I noticed the trash in the kitchen was over flowing . I quickly gathered the trash that had fallen out , and put it in the bag . Pulling the bag out was heavy and difficult , but I finally got it up and out . I tied it tightly so nothing would come out and took it outside to the big trash can by the curb . The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out . I pulled open the top of the bag and shook it out to make it expand . I slid it down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure it did n't slip down in the can . Putting the top on the can I put it back by the refrigerator , and thought about what I was going to make for supper .|When did they get inside?|After they came home from work|1

I pulled open the top of the bag and shook it out to make it expand . I slid it down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure it did n't slip down in the can . Putting the top on the can I put it back by the refrigerator , and thought about what I was going to make for supper .|Where is the cabinet?|Refrigerator|0
One day , my wife asked me if I could take the children to school so that she could attend an important meeting with her boss . I said that I would . Once my three children were ready to go , we all hopped in the car and were on our way . Since the children were all in different grades , I had to go to two different schools to drop them all off . First I went to the local elementary school and dropped off Amy and Jessica , who are in 1st and 3rd grade , respectively . I waited to make sure that they got through the front door safely , then I continued to the local middle school to drop off my son Fred who is in the 7th grade . Once we arrived , I again waited in the car to make sure that Fred made it through the front door safely .|What did they get ready for?|practice|0

I was so excited to put the poster of my favorite sports team up after buying it . The poster came rolled up like a tube , and the first thing I did was gently unroll it , taking care to not damage any of the edges or corners . Once the poster was unrolled , I grabbed my roll of scotch tape . I decided the poster would look best on the wall next to my bed , so I held the poster to the wall . Once I was satisfied with the poster 's placement , I pulled off a piece of tape . I placed the piece of tape on the top center of the poster and then fastened it to the wall . I then pulled off a second piece of tape and stuck it the center area at the bottom of the poster . Once the poster was secured to the wall , I stepped back and enjoyed the picture of my favorite sports team !|When did they make sure it was straight?|Once they were satisfied with the placement|1

My wife and I decided to invite some friends over . We wanted to clean our and house and make it look good after it was messed up by my daughter . One of the first things that we did to clean was to get out the vacuum . I took the plug and put it in a socket that was close to the area of the floor that I wanted to clean . I hit the power button and the vacuum started to make a weird noise . I opened the vacuum up and cleaned the inside out . I pushed the vacuum all over the floor in every part of the house . It was very loud and it was nice to push the power button and turn it off when I was finished .|When could they take the vacuum out of the closet?|when leaving the house dirty|0

This week my mom assigned us all chores to do around the house . My chore was to clean the kitchen after dinner . After we all finished eating and everyone had left the table I started to clear it . Starting with the plates . Then carefully placed this in the sink . Then I placed each glass on top of the next . And once they were all stacked I used the top cup to gather he spoons and knifes and forks in . Finally I was able to wipe down and clean off the table top , making sure nothing was sticky or wet . I then decided I would place a small glass vase in the center of the now cleared kitchen table , with a few wildflowers from our own backyard garden .|When did they stack the plates?|while picking wildflowers|0

I had always wanted to learn to swim , but was really scared . They had just opened a new swimming pool in my town that was giving lessons , so I decided to sign up for a class . I was really nervous . When I got there everyone was already there . I could tell I was n't the only one that was nervous . The swim teacher was really nice and did a good job of calming our nerves . I felt so comfortable that I was already going under water and dog paddling by the end of the first class . I decided that I would continue to take the classes until I was swimming well . I have really enjoyed taking these classes and do n't know why I took so long to learn how to swim .|What would she not go back for if she didn't like it?|town|0

Yesterday , I was riding my bike when , all of a sudden , I hit a rock and fell . Oh no ! My pants were ripped . When I got home , my mother said that we could sew them . She said she would teach me how . First , we got a needle and a spool of blue thread . At first , I could n't put the thread through the hole in the needle , but eventually , I got it . We laid the pants on the table , and then my mother showed me how to sew . We poked the needle through the cloth , up through it , and then back down . It took me a long time , but by the end , there was no longer a rip in my pants .|What was done to the needle?|the needle was used to cut cloth|0

Last year I adopted my dog . First , I researched where the nearest animal shelters were around me . After I found a few animal shelters , I got into my car and drove to one of them . I visited with the animals , and saw one dog named Chester that I really liked . I went back home afterwards and began to research how to take care of pets . Once I had read about how to properly take care of an animal , I had to go and buy the supplies necessary . When I was all ready , I went back to the shelter and asked to adopt the dog . After I received all of the proper paperwork , I jumped back in the car with my new friend and drove home . It was a great decision .|What is the scenario in question?|Adopting a pet|1

Each and every six months , I have to visit the dentist , to make sure my teeth are healthy and clean . The last visit , I went in and said `` hello '' to the receptionist . She checked me in and said the hygienist would be with me shortly . The hygienist is the person you see first , who cleans your teeth with a scraper , flosses them , and sometimes treats them with a pasty substance called fluoride . He said I had one small cavity , which I normally do n't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months . A cavity can be a little scary , since the dentist goes in with a drill . I was scared it would hurt , but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in my mouth and injected something called Novocaine . Afterwards , I talked funny for a little while , but had healthy and clean teeth again .|What made their mouth go numb?|The hygienist used novocaine in the patient's mouth|1

I find doing laundry is relatively easy work . You just have to keep up . Every day I go around and collect all of the dirty clothes from the bedrooms and bathrooms and pile it all up outside the laundry closet -LRB- it is n't big enough to be called a laundry room . -RRB- I separate the clothes into their various loads ; underwear all goes into one pile , towels and wash rags go into another piles , jeans go into yet another pile and all the shirts go into another pile . I turn it on and let it start filling with water . I wait until the entire bottom is filled with water then I pour in the proper amount of detergent . Only then do I start loading in the clothes . I usually do it one article of clothing at a time , moving around the drum so the load stays balanced . Once it 's full , I simply close the door and let it run . When it stops , you take the clothes out and move them to the dryer .|When did the machine do all the work?|When training for a gold medal.|0

Last week , on a beautiful sunny afternoon , I decided to take my niece Kathy to the playground . We were lucky because there were other children about her age already playing on the swings and slides . Kathy is chatty and likes to make friends by asking kids if she can play with them . She soon began to speak to another little girl names Eva and they were soon taking turns pushing each other on the swing . The two friends then decided to get in line for the slide . Kathy went first because she is a little more daring and her friend . Eva had never been on the tallest slide at the playground before but when she saw Kathy go down without a problem , she felt brave too . After a while , Kathy and Eva got tired of climbing up the slide so they went off to the moneky bars . When it was time to go the new friends gave each other a hug and promised to see each other at the playground on the next sunny day .|Where were Kathy and Eva hung by their knees?|swing set|0

I am on ketogenic diet , so eggs are like life saver . I always buy good quality eggs . Other day I bought some free roaming eggs from market . I want to make scrambled eggs . Then with fork I whipped them for a while when they mixed very well , but did not overdo . I turned on my stove , put the nonstick pan on and turned stove on medium heat . Meanwhile I got some cheese and salsa out for extra flavor . When the pan was hot enough , I added 2 tablespoon of unsalted butter -LRB- I love butter -RRB- , and then I did not wait it to be hot , but immediately poured my eggs into pan . In a minute , I started to stir my eggs , added some cheese and salsa , salt and some pepper . I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked . When all moisture disappeared , I moved pan from stove , transferred it to plate .|When did they start to bubble and cook?|after pouring into pan|1

Then with fork I whipped them for a while when they mixed very well , but did not overdo . I turned on my stove , put the nonstick pan on and turned stove on medium heat . Meanwhile I got some cheese and salsa out for extra flavor . When the pan was hot enough , I added 2 tablespoon of unsalted butter -LRB- I love butter -RRB- , and then I did not wait it to be hot , but immediately poured my eggs into pan . In a minute , I started to stir my eggs , added some cheese and salsa , salt and some pepper . I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked .

I need to go grocery shopping this weekend so I am in the process of making a shopping list . I 'll look through my fridge , freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly ; coffee , stevia , mint tea bags , paper towels . I 'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant . When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price . I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store . I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for , I will put that on the other side of the paper . Once I have my list made , I 'll double check it and head out to go shopping .|What did they check to see if they already had?|items that they use frequently|1

I ca n't stand clutter in my house , and the garbage in my kitchen was full . I knew I had to take it out right away . I pulled the bag out of the garbage can . A few things fell out as I was doing this , so I picked them up and put them back in the bag . I then had to take it to the dumpster outside so the trash company could come get it . I walked out the door , down my steps , and over to the dumpster . I raised the lid and dropped the bag inside . I made sure the lid was closed before I went back inside so no animals would get into my garbage . When I went back in , I remembered to put a new garbage bag in the can so I could throw more things away without making a huge mess .|What did they tie?|The garbage bag.|1

I usually fold my clothes after I take them out of the dryer . Some people do not , as rumpled casual is OK to wear these days . Folding clothes makes them easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers . If you are going to iron the clothes later , they are less rumpled if you have folded them first . I put them in piles according to clothing type . The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes . I smooth out my socks and put them in pairs , tucking them together at the tops so they stay together . First I lay the item on the bed , smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat , then I fold it into one or two parts . Men 's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage . This is still folding them , as it minimizes the wrinkles . I fold T-shirt , after smoothing them out , by folding the sleeves in first , then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters . Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them . I do n't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes , as my husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear . After I am done folding the clothes I put them away on a shelf in the closet or in drawers .|What do they lay on the bed to fold?|clothing|1

Folding clothes makes them easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers . If you are going to iron the clothes later , they are less rumpled if you have folded them first . I put them in piles according to clothing type . The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes . I smooth out my socks and put them in pairs , tucking them together at the tops so they stay together . First I lay the item on the bed , smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat , then I fold it into one or two parts . Men 's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage . This is still folding them , as it minimizes the wrinkles . I fold T-shirt , after smoothing them out , by folding the sleeves in first , then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters . Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them . I do n't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes , as my husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear .

When I was ten my family renovated the kitchen of our house . It was so interesting to watch the builders work . They had many blue prints , that architects had drawn to detail what work had to be done . They also had new cabinets and floors tiles and appliances . They removed some walls while building out others , and laid a new tile floor . They installed all the new cabinets and ran the water pipes and electricity to put in all the new appliances we got . It took them a few weeks to do but when it was done our kitchen was newer and so beautiful . It had better windows and more lights and it was easy to get around and cook in it . Renovating a room can be fun and really give your house a new look .|What did the builders want to make sure was correct?|The blueprint of the kitchen|1

I wanted to throw a Bachelorette Party for my best friend . She lives in Dallas , but she wants to have her party in New Orleans for a girls weekend . The first thing we did was talk about the theme of the party . We decided on the theme of `` Something Blue '' . We would have all colors of blue and activities that have titles with the word blue for the whole weekend . She gave me a list of 20 girls . I created an invitation that had blue and included a picture of her . I also included an itinerary of our weekend activities with all of our fun `` blue '' titles , to set the fun mood . I sealed them before hand writing the addresses and adding a stamp . next , they were off to the post office , so everyone could be invited to our fun weekend .|How many people on the guest list?|all|0

We would have all colors of blue and activities that have titles with the word blue for the whole weekend . She gave me a list of 20 girls . I created an invitation that had blue and included a picture of her . I also included an itinerary of our weekend activities with all of our fun `` blue '' titles , to set the fun mood . I sealed them before hand writing the addresses and adding a stamp . next , they were off to the post office , so everyone could be invited to our fun weekend .|Where did she place the invitations?|Dallas|0

I asked my guest if she would like some iced tea . She replied that she would . I went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . I removed a clean glass from the cabinet . I then added ice from the freezer to the glass . Once I had the glass mostly filled with ice , I poured into the glass enough tea so that the glass was almost full . I took a few packets of sugar from the sugar bowl on the counter . Then I brought out to my guest the glass of tea , the sugar packets , and the spoon . I placed the tea on a coaster before her and set down next to the glass the sugar and teaspoon in case she wanted to sweeten her tea .|What did they remove from the silverware drawer?|sugar packets|0

Saturday is the day I always clean my entire apartment including both of my full bathrooms . To begin cleaning the bathroom I always start with the tub because it is the biggest surface to clean . First I sprayed the bleach cleaner into the tub and then I let it sit for a few minutes . After the tub I sprayed the same solution into the toilet and scrubbed the toilet with the scrubbing brush . I then scrubbed the sink and the faucet until they were shining . Next I sprayed the mirror with Windex and cleaned that until it was as clear as could be . I used my swifter wet jet and sprayed the solution and scrubbed the floor until it was completely clean . Once one bathroom is done I do the exact same process to the second bathroom .|What is scrubbed after a few minutes?|Tub|1

When I was sick coughing last week , my body would n't stop coughing . I felt really sick and so I decided to go to the doctor . When I went to the doctor , they asked me if I was going to have to pay for the visit . I told them that I did , because of my insurance , and so I paid a little bit of money . After a few minutes , my name was called and I visited with my doctor . He stuck a popsicle stick down my throat to see if everything was fine . He said it looked good , so I must be coughing because I 'm a little too thirsty . He also sent me home to get some rest there .|When did they want to get better?|right away|1

I have a poster I like a lot and wanted to put it on my bedroom wall . The first thing I did was clean away the spot on the wall where I thought the poster should go up . Next I cleared away a space on a dining room table so I could lay the poster flat , face down . I peeled away the plastic paper on the back of the tape and attached it to the poster around the outside . Then I peeled away the plastic paper on the other side of the tape . I carried the poster to the wall and took the top two corners of the poster , and placed those where I wanted them to be and pushed them down , making sure the top of the poster looked straight . After this I pressed down the sides of the posters also where the double-sided tape was , and kept the poster tight at the same time . Then I pressed down along the bottom of the poster as well .|What did they use to put the poster up with?|staples|0

I have a poster I like a lot and wanted to put it on my bedroom wall . The first thing I did was clean away the spot on the wall where I thought the poster should go up . Next I cleared away a space on a dining room table so I could lay the poster flat , face down . I peeled away the plastic paper on the back of the tape and attached it to the poster around the outside . Then I peeled away the plastic paper on the other side of the tape .

Last night I wanted to watch my favorite movie . I had the movie on a DVD disk . I got the case the movie came from out of the DVD closet . I opened it up and checked to see if it had any scratches . It did not . I turned on my television . Then I turned the channel to the right output source , using the remote control that goes with my television . I needed to plug in the DVD player . I took the wires from the DVD player , and matched the colors and shapes to the plug ins on the back of the television . Then I plugged the DVD player in . I took the disk I had and put it in the player . I made sure everything was working just right . I enjoyed watching the movie very much .|How did they want to match the plug ins on the back of the television?|matched the colours and shapes of the television|1

When I was 16 , I asked a girl to go on a date with me . I went up to her after class and I asked her if she wanted to go to a concert with me . I think she liked me and she said yes . That night , I went and I picked her up . She got into my car after I opened her door . We drove to the concert and talked about what we liked to do and what we thought about each other .

It seems like it should be easy to cook rice , but there are lots of different types and knowing how long to soak and then boil it can be tricky . I selected a nice mild basmati rice to cook for dinner . I took out the container and looked at the instructions . I poured two cups of water into the pot and added one cup of rice . I let it soak for 15 minutes , and then I turned on the burner . Once the water started boiling , I covered the pot and reduced the temperature to simmer for ten minutes . I let the rice sit covered for five minutes , and then I fluffed it with a fork . I put it in a bowl to enjoy .|When did their timer go off?|five minutes|0

My friend Joe , who is a construction worker , decided to help me lay tile in my new house the other day . We went into the kitchen and removed all of the old , worn out tile from the floor . We then sanded down the floor and prepared it to receive the new tile . After this , we took a trip to the Home Depot to pick out exactly what new tile I wanted . After buying enough tile to cover the entire floor , we went back to my house . Slowly , tile by tile , we put industrial glue on the bottom of each tile and carefully set it into a neat pattern on the floor . We did this until the entire floor of the kitchen was covered , and then put rubber strips around the outer wall .|What did they let sit and dry?|The new tile floor|1

Everyone had just finished eating a delicious Thanksgiving dinner together as a family . After everyone left the table , my sister and I picked up all the plates and silverware and took them into the kitchen for washing . We worked together to gather all the glasses and put them into the dishwasher . I removed the salt and pepper shakers and put them away while my sister put the butter back into the refrigerator . My sister cleared the tablecloth of crumbs , took it off the table and set it aside to be washed . I sprayed the table with kitchen cleaner and wiped it down with a clean kitchen towel . Together , my sister and I pushed all the chairs back in under the table . Now our table was clean and ready for its next task , the setting of the family UNO game .|What was cleared from the table?|Uno cards|0

After everyone left the table , my sister and I picked up all the plates and silverware and took them into the kitchen for washing . We worked together to gather all the glasses and put them into the dishwasher . I removed the salt and pepper shakers and put them away while my sister put the butter back into the refrigerator . My sister cleared the tablecloth of crumbs , took it off the table and set it aside to be washed . I sprayed the table with kitchen cleaner and wiped it down with a clean kitchen towel . Together , my sister and I pushed all the chairs back in under the table . Now our table was clean and ready for its next task , the setting of the family UNO game .|When was the remaining food crumbs cleared from the table?|after taking cups|1
My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish . Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market . When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up . When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones . Some of the fish he buys still has the head , fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too . I like it better when he leaves the scales -LRB- skin -RRB- of the fish as it tastes really good . There are many different ways that he cooks the fish . Sometimes he will fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it . My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi . In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it . My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain .|He bakes the fish in what?|Pan|1

One afternoon I was feeling thirsty and decided to make myself a pot of tea . I grabbed my tea kettle and dumped out all the water that was sitting in there and replaced it with fresh cool water . I placed the full kettle on the stove and turned on the burner to the highest setting to boil the water . I decided to have green tea that day , and scooped about 5 teaspoons of tea into the pot . Once the kettle was steaming , I turned off the stove and let it cool down a little . I poured the water in the pot and replaced the lid of the pot . When the tea was done steeping , I poured myself a cup into a tea cup that I had warmed up with some of the excess hot water . Then I enjoyed my tea when it was cool enough to drink .|When did they stir it?|after dumping out all the water|0

Garbage truck was scheduled for tomorrow . I have big garbage can , and it was kind of full , I wanted it to be out so does not stay in garbage can for another week . I pressed the content more in , so there is some more pace for me to tie the bag . Then I lifted bag upwards , and put it on floor . I sifted it further by knocking the bag to floor , and then grabbed t sides of bag and tied it , Then grabbed remaining 2 sides and tied another knot . I out it aside and then grabbed my fresh bag , opened it with my fingers . I wet my hands and it opened quickly . Then I slide the bag down making sure the sides are fully attached with bag . I put extra portion out of the bag for more protection .|What was tricky to open?|garbage bag|1

Yesterday , I was very hungry , and did n't know what to eat for dinner . There was nothing in the pantry . Then I remembered that we still had spaghetti left from dinner the night before . Perfect ! I would eat spaghetti . I decided I had to heat it in the microwave . First , I put the cold spaghetti in a bowl , and then covered it with plastic wrap , so that it would n't splatter and get the microwave dirty . I put the bowl in the microwave , and set the timer for two minutes . The microwave started and I waited . It felt like forever , because I was so hungry ! When , finally , it finished cooking the spaghetti and beeped , I checked to make sure it was warm . It was ! It was delicious , and I was happy .|When did they take the spaghetti out of the fridge?|After heating it|0

My best friend and I got two tickets to a semi final match at the US Open . We were so excited that we would get to see Venus Williams playing . She was up against Sloan Stewart . We found our seats and got comfortable . The crowd jumped to its feet when the two players walked out holding their raquets . Within a few minutes , Sloan served the ball and Venus easily returned it . So it was tied up in the third . Both players were sweating but they looked like they still had energy . Venus took the first two games and dominated the court .

I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room . The room was in dire need of new wall paper . The old wall paper was looking bad . He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work . I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan . We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls . We checked to make sure everything was even . I did not want uneven wall paper . After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones . We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went . I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh . Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend .|Who did they ask to help them?|susan|0

I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan . We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls . We checked to make sure everything was even . I did not want uneven wall paper . After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones . We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went .

The walk home in the rain had drenched our clothes . We were sopping wet as we ran into the house laughing . After grabbing towels and bathrobes in exchange for the soggy rags our clothes had become I carried the garments , sopping with water , into the laundry room to dry them in the clothes dryer . First I had to set the temperature of the dryer . A medium temperature seemed like the best idea there . Then I had to choose how long to dry them . Thirty minutes ? Sixty minutes ? With no clue how long it would take I set the timer dial to automatic , surely the dryer would know more about how much time it would take than I would . With everything attended to I closed the door , pressed the start button and we watched through the little circular window as the clothes tumbled around in the machine . After about forty five minutes the buzzer on the dryer sounded and the machine shut itself off . I opened the door to a gust of hot air and lavender scent . One by one I pulled the dry articles of clothing out of the appliance and we put our pants and shirts and socks all back on . A fun night in all , if I do say so myself .|When did they shut the door to the dryer?|after drying|0

I looked around my room and decided that it needed a change . I went to the phone book to look up the name of a service that could help me . There weer many different options and I picked the one that looked like it was the most popular .  He arrived and gave me photos of samples of other rooms he did . I picked some features of the renovated room I wanted and explained how I imagined the rest . The man took my information and began to draw up a set of plans just for me .  The man sent work crews to my house and they worked for a week to renovate my room . I loved the final result and then I paid the man for his services .|What did they review|fabric samples|0

There weer many different options and I picked the one that looked like it was the most popular .  He arrived and gave me photos of samples of other rooms he did . I picked some features of the renovated room I wanted and explained how I imagined the rest . The man took my information and began to draw up a set of plans just for me .  The man sent work crews to my house and they worked for a week to renovate my room . I loved the final result and then I paid the man for his services .|What did they approve|the swimming pool plans|0
This morning , I was on my way to work when I noticed that the fuel light was on on the dashboard of the car . I spotted a gas station and pulled in next to one of the pumps - making sure that I remembered to pull in with the fuel door on the car closest to the pump . Before opening my driver side door , I quickly grabbed my bank card and pushed the fuel door button that was located near the bottom of my seat . I looked at the pump and inserted my payment card in the payment slot and then selected the type of gas that my car uses . I then opened the fuel door , took the gas nozzle from the pump and inserted it into the gas tank . The handle had a jumping sensation as an indication that my tank was full and the job was finished . I removed the nozzle from the tank and placed it back on the pump , took my receipt , jumped in my car and headed off to work|Where was the gas flowing?|Into the gas tank.|1

I went to visit the doctor last week because of a sore throat . The first thing I did after getting to the doctor 's office was check in at the main desk . The receptionist asked me my name and input it into her computer . The receptionist asked to see my driver 's license and insurance card , and then asked me to pay my copay , which was $ 15 . I waited , and after a few minutes , a medical assistant called my name so I went with her into the exam room . The assistant measured my height , weight , temperature , heart rate , and blood pressure , and I responded to her questions about why I was there and what medications I take . After inputting the data into a computer she left and I waited in the exam room until the doctor arrived . The doctor then looked into my eyes , ears , and throat with a bright light and felt my glands on my throat and neck . The doctor listened to my heart and my breathing through a stethoscope . After looking at data in the computer , the doctor said that I did not need a prescription , and that I should treat my sore throat with rest , lots of liquids , and an over-the-counter pain and fever reliever . After that , both the doctor and I left the exam room , and I went home and followed the doctor 's advice to rest , drink liquids , and take an over-the-counter pain killer/fever reliever .|After what did the receptionist ask them to take a seat in the waiting room?|before checking in|0

In the town I used to live in , there usually was n't much to do as far as activities go . However , when the local bowling alley opened up , that instantly became a popular spot to hang out . It had just about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar , and they served great food . We would start things off with an actual game of bowling . We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes , followed by getting our lane . While one person set up the game of bowling , the rest of us would go and get the right sized bowling ball that we wanted . I usually always came in last , since I 'm not very good at bowling . After the game of bowling , we 'd go off ad play arcade games and laser tag .|where was a usual trip to?|local bowling alley|1

I decided to get dressed in some nice dress clothes before I went to church . After I was dressed , I took my car keys , got into my car , and drove to church . I entered the church along with plenty of other people who were also attending church that morning . I took out my Bible which I kept in my purse . I read it a little while waiting for the service to begin . The pastor then went to the front of the church and thanked everyone for coming . He asked us to turn to a certain page of our Bibles to read a verse with him , so I turned to the page and read along . I listened intently and felt very moved by his words .

I decided to get dressed in some nice dress clothes before I went to church . After I was dressed , I took my car keys , got into my car , and drove to church . I entered the church along with plenty of other people who were also attending church that morning . I took out my Bible which I kept in my purse . I read it a little while waiting for the service to begin . The pastor then went to the front of the church and thanked everyone for coming . He asked us to turn to a certain page of our Bibles to read a verse with him , so I turned to the page and read along . I listened intently and felt very moved by his words . When the service was over , I thanked him for his work and went home .|What did he began telling them about?|The Bible|1
It was time for the weekly football game ! But first we had to gear up . Safety was important in a contact sport like football , so we had to put on our uniforms and all of our protective padding . He gave us a pep talk and reminded us how we were supposed to play the first quarter , what plays and strategies we were supposed to use . Then we put our hands in the circle , cheered for ourselves , and started the game . We followed our coach 's playbook , throwing the ball , running defense , tackling the guys on the other team . Sometimes we scored a touchdown and sometimes we did n't . Our team had practiced every day , though , and we knew what we were doing . Our coach kept up the pep talks and advice through each quarter of the game as we swapped out tired players for new ones and kept running across the field and scoring goals . It was a great football game !|What did they grab before circling around the coach?|their gear|1

Every morning I take a bath . Before I get into the bath tub , I turn on the water . I adjust the cold and the hot water to make a bearable temperature . After the water is just right , I take off all my clothes and enter the tub . I pour water on my body then I lather up with either soap or shower gel . Once I have soap all over my body , I take my loofah sponge and pour soap on that as well . I do this to ensure that all the dirt washes off my skin . While I am scrubbing my body , I like to sing in the shower . After I scrub really good and finish singing , I pour water continuously on my body until all the soap washes off .|What do they stay in until they feel clean?|The bath tub|1

The seats were oily and the floor was sticky . The cushions smelled of butter that was fake . It was dim , but the there was excitement in the air . Tension was high , and hopes were through the roof that this would be a decent showing . I turned to my friend and smiled , and the lights cut out . The projector clicked on , and the first titles showed on the screen . The movie had begun to play . What ensued next was a cavalcade of ridiculous excitement . Cliches , poor acting , and abysmal dialogue played out across 90 minutes of cinematic excrement , and we loved every minute of it . By the time the movie had ended , we were all beaming with happiness at our night .|What came from the crowd?|happiness|1

Last night , I threw pizza into the trash can and some plates and I realized that the bag was starting to get full . I tried to fit some more in but upon realizing that I could n't , I decided to replace the bag . I pulled out the garbage bag current bag , while trying not to spill any of the trash on the floor and had a new bag prepared . Upon tying the bag , I took it outside and placed it on the front lawn , where the trash people always pick it up . I then pushed the new trash bag down so that I knew that I could fit any new trash into the bag and I then stopped . This experience was regular and easy and was influenced by the same routine that I always follow weekly .|What did they put in the trash can before they tied the old trash?|A new bag|0

I pulled out the garbage bag current bag , while trying not to spill any of the trash on the floor and had a new bag prepared . Upon tying the bag , I took it outside and placed it on the front lawn , where the trash people always pick it up . I then pushed the new trash bag down so that I knew that I could fit any new trash into the bag and I then stopped . This experience was regular and easy and was influenced by the same routine that I always follow weekly .|when did they tie the old trashbag?|before taking it outside|1

My husband and I recently bought a house . First we had to go to the bank to get a loan . The bank checked our credit history and gave us the loan .  Next , we looked for a house .  We also looked for neighborhoods in good school districts , and near a park and grocery store . We found a nice house for sale in a neighborhood we liked . It has three bedrooms and is in good shape .  She showed us the inside of the house , and we really liked it . We then put in an application for the house , and waited to hear back from the real estate agent . A few weeks later , she called us and told us we got the house .  We will move in soon .|When did they go to the neighborhoods to look for a house?|After the bank approved their loan|1

Yesterday afternoon I got my new bank statement , so I balanced my checkbook immediately . First , I gathered up all my receipts and my check register . Then I got a calculator and a pen . When I finished with that , I checked other transactions such as checks I ’d written against the statement . While this time I had n’t forgotten to enter any transactions , if I had , I would add those to my check register and adjust my balance . Once I was sure that the entries in my check register are complete , I checked my balance again . If it does n’t match the statement , I look for outstanding transactions such as checks that have n’t cleared . Once I subtracted the outstanding checks , my account balanced , so I put my receipts in the envelope with my bank statement and filed it in my business files .|What do they check off against the charges on the statement?|Business files|0

For my anniversary with my husband , I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast . One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice . I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part !|When did they plug the juicer in?|after squeezing oranges|0

For my anniversary with my husband , I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast . One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice . I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part !|What did they slice?|oranges|1
Now I am going to set the dining table up for dinner . First I put away all the stuff that is not supposed to be on the table . Next I clean the table with a tissue paper . Then I arrange some of the decorations on the table . After that I put down the plates and glasses.lastly in the remaining spaces on the table I put down what we are going to eat but I do n't put down dessert yet . I call my family down for dinner . I swept a drop of sweat of my chin and forehead . It was hard hard work but still it was so much fun . Oh no my family is done with dinner and now I have to bring them dessert which is fruit I made myself .|What is left to do?|Call the family for dinner|0

I looked up directions to the concert venue on my computer before leaving and printed the directions on my printer . I made sure I had my concert ticket in my wallet . I locked up my house and got into the car . Once I arrived , I located a parking space and parked the car . There was a charge for the parking spot , so I paid the parking lot attendant . He gave me a colored ticket in exchange and I placed this ticket inside my car on the dash where it was clearly visible from the outside of the car . I gave the event staffer my ticket , which she punched and returned to me . I entered the performance hall and located my seat . Once I located my seat , I sat down and made sure to set my phone on silent .|How were they able to get to the venue?|train|0

Me and my nephews went into the pool and started moving into it while we waited for their swimming instructor . First we did some freestyle , and after a few minutes it transformed into a funny " dog style " , just paddling with our arms and legs like dogs do when they swim . When the instructor came , he greeted the children . All of them stood on one edge of the pool when I swam to the side just to give all of them space to train . He made a circle with his arms and told the children to jump through it head first into the water , with arms stretching forward and touching each other . He made all children repeat the diving until he thought everyone got it decently right , since there was age variety among the 12 students , ages 5 to 15 . The diving practice took some 15 minutes . I told him I only knew butterfly stroke from Wikipedia so I would be more than happy to give it a try . He gave me some instructions about how to make the stroke better , and it took another 45 minutes to help the children practice theirs . After one hour had passed , we got out of the pool , the teacher said goodbye to everyone and we all gave him our payment for the hour of class .|Who did he start teaching?|the instructor|0

After one hour had passed , we got out of the pool , the teacher said goodbye to everyone and we all gave him our payment for the hour of class .|Who did he tell to practice?|The 12 students.|1
Me and my nephews went into the pool and started moving into it while we waited for their swimming instructor . First we did some freestyle , and after a few minutes it transformed into a funny " dog style " , just paddling with our arms and legs like dogs do when they swim . When the instructor came , he greeted the children . All of them stood on one edge of the pool when I swam to the side just to give all of them space to train . He made a circle with his arms and told the children to jump through it head first into the water , with arms stretching forward and touching each other . He made all children repeat the diving until he thought everyone got it decently right , since there was age variety among the 12 students , ages 5 to 15 . The diving practice took some 15 minutes .

I got the best present yesterday ! My little boy painted me a picture of him and me next to a rainbow . He did a really great job on the painting and he was very proud of his master piece . He and I walked around the house with the painting and looked for the perfect spot . We looked in the living room , the kitchen , the playroom , and even the bathroom . We finally decided it would look best in my bedroom . That way I could always see it and it would be with me . We took the painting , a nail , a hammer and a tape measure and headed into my room to hang it up . I put the nail in a little and let my little boy hammer it is , too . We hung the painting on the nail and it was the perfect touch that my room needed .|What kind of spot was chosen?|the living room|0

Sometimes I let my cleaning get out of hand . I do n't like to cook . I try to do as little of it as possible and only refrigerate .  I do not have many dishes .  I am getting better about it . I found out that eggs are a really bad one to leave out . I left egg remnants out on the counter .  Three days later I had maggots , which was gross , but it happened quicker than I would have expected .  I ran out of detergent recently .  That means I had a film of cocoa from soaking a dish that stayed in my kitchen sink for a couple days .  I was still glad to be able to clean that up . It only takes a minute to wipe the counters , which helps too .|When did they attract bugs?|after they cleaned everything|0

At 2:00 in the afternoon , I realized I had n't eaten lunch yet . I remembered I had some leftover pasta from dinner out two nights ago . I went to the refrigerator and pulled it out . I covered it with plastic wrap and walked over to the microwave . I estimated it would take about two minutes to heat up , so I set the timer to that . I put it in , shut the door and hit the start button . After about a minute I opened the microwave , took the bowl out , removed the plastic wrap and stirred my pasta . After the beeper went off , I took the bowl out , closed the door , took the plastic off and enjoyed my left over pasta .|When did they put the pasta back in the microwave?|After they ate it|0

I put it in , shut the door and hit the start button . After about a minute I opened the microwave , took the bowl out , removed the plastic wrap and stirred my pasta . After the beeper went off , I took the bowl out , closed the door , took the plastic off and enjoyed my left over pasta .|Where was the item put back into?|Back into the fridge.|0
This morning I decided to clean our bathroom shower in our house . I knew it should only take about fifteen minutes so I got started right away . I gathered together a cleaning sponge , a shower cleaning spray , a rinse cup , and a towel to dry my hands . Next I sprayed the shower with a shower cleaner . I allowed this to stay on the walls about five minutes . Then I took a wet sponge and began rubbing the tub and shower walls with a circular motion . I used this to wash off all the soap from the walls . I checked to make sure I did n't miss any spots . I placed the shampoo , soap , and razors back into their spots . I dried my hands , and I was done .|In addition to bottles and razors, what else did they remove from the shower?|faucet|0

I go to the gym about twice a week . I went to the gym this morning , and it was a great time . When I go to the gym , I like to do the elliptical . While running on the elliptical , I put my favorite show on so I can watch it . I watch one entire episode and do n't stop running until it 's over . It 's a great way to motivate myself to stay at the gym ! I like to lift weights one day a week , and the other two days is dedicated entirely to cardio . Running is my favorite gym activity because it gives me time to myself and to think . Lifting weights is fun too , but it takes more effort for me to lift weights .|Where did the person go?|favorite show|0

I have been promising my girls a pet cat but kept putting it off . I had n't been feeling well and I felt I had enough to work on around my house to worry about a pet . Unfortunately I I had been having a lot of issues with mice . My husband bought a few traps and set them up once , but would n't follow through with emptying them and resetting them , or figureing out how to stop from coming in in the first place . After I spent hours cleaning out nests I found inside my couches , I gave up and decided having a cat would be fare less work than dealing with this mess and hopefully might help with the mice issue . We liked her , and she seemed to like us . She had been fixed and had a chip . We filled out some paperwork and paid some fees , and took her home .|What did they find at the humane society?|mice|0

Last week , my boyfriend and I went on a date . First , we went out to dinner at a local restaurant . It was a new Indian cuisine place called `` Lazy Garden . '' He had a few kebabs and I had an Indian and Asian fusion salad . After finishing dinner , we went to a movie . We saw a special showing of older movies on modern screens . We saw `` Jaws , '' and it was very interesting to see a movie that came out before we were both born on the big screen . We both jumped when the Jaws jumped out of the water as we nibbled on our Goobers and Sour Patch Kids . When the movie was over , we drove to a local park and just talked as we stared up at the stars .|When did the romantic evening end?|After they stargazed at the park.|1

I like to make clothes on my sewing machine . I can choose exactly which fabrics to use and exactly what design I want them to be . I can also make them to fit me perfectly . I decided to make a dress . When I got home , I opened the pattern and spread out all the pattern pages . Each page has patterns for different pieces of the dress in different sizes . They are all printed over each other . I looked on the instructions to work out which size I wanted to make the dress , and found which color of line I needed to cut along . I cut out all the pieces . There was a front and a back piece , a sleeve pattern , which I needed to cut two of , and a collar . Then I cut around the paper pattern and through the fabric to get the fabric pieces the right shape . Then I pinned the pieces together with the front of the fabric on the inside . I sewed along each edge with my sewing machine . Then I sewed the sleeve seam , and then sewed the sleeve to the dress . Finally I sewed the collar to the neckline of the dress . All of that was done with the inside of the fabric facing out , so the seams would end up on the inside when I turned it right-side out . So finally I turned it right side out , all the seams ended up on the inside , and I had a new dress to wear .|Where did they buy the fabric?|Fabric store|1

Last weekend , my friend and I worked in the garden . The weather was nice and sunny outside , so we decided it would be the perfect day to spend time outdoors in our backyard garden . Our garden has a lot of flowers in it , but we thought it would be fun to plant some vegetables as well . We went to the store and picked up some supplies that we would need , like a small shovel , a small watering can , and some vegetable seeds -LRB- including carrot seeds , tomato seeds , and cucumber seeds -RRB- . We then went to our backyard and started to dig small holes in the soil so that we would have space to plant our seeds . Then we filled the watering can and watered each small mound of soil that had seeds underneath . All in all , working in the garden was a great way to spend the afternoon .|What did they drop into the small holes?|seeds|1

I walked down the stairs in search of some medicine for my mother . I did not want to her to get sick so I was in a hurry . I opened my drawer and grabbed her medicine for her cold . I opened the bottle and grabbed one pill . I then ran up the stairs . My mother was on the bed and was waiting for me . I gave her the pill .

Last week , I played a game of tennis with my grandfather . Before beginning to play , I grabbed rackets from the closet and a bucket of balls . I put them in the living room and grabbed water s that I could have some while I played . After doing this , I walked to the tennis court with my grandfather and started to play . We first just hit the ball around , then practiced serving , and finally played a game . We gave each other advice and tried to play as serious as best as we could . It was a fun experience and we both felt that we were getting a good workout , while also playing the sport well . Once we played a real game , we served the ball hard at each other and attempted to win the game .|What was it about?|Playing basketball|0

I will select one article of clothing to iron first . I set up my ironing board , and plug in the iron .

I wait a minute or so , and then lay my first shirt or pants on the ironing board . I will take the iron and smooth out the shirt carefully , but deliberately .

One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis . When I play tennis , a friend and I go to a special place called a court , which is made just for playing tennis . The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle .  To play tennis , we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets .  If you do n't hit the ball back when it 's hit to you , or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court , you score points .  When you score once , you get fifteen points . When you score again , you get another fifteen points , so you have 30 points . Score a third time , you get 10 points , giving you a total of 40 .|When do they get 40 points|when the ball goes outside the court|0

The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle .  To play tennis , we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets .  If you do n't hit the ball back when it 's hit to you , or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court , you score points .  When you score once , you get fifteen points . When you score again , you get another fifteen points , so you have 30 points . Score a third time , you get 10 points , giving you a total of 40 .|What sport is scoring different than other sports?|hockey|0

Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis . Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people , sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs . There is a low net between both people playing the game . Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores . The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set . We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired , then we came home . It was really a good workout for the both of us and we would like to take you to watch and play the next time we decide to play tennis .|They used what to hit the ball?|Tennis rackets.|1

I had n't gone for a hair cut in about 7 weeks so I was certainly due . The hair around the side of my head was starting to grow over my ears . I generally go the same hairdresser and ask for the same person , Sue who is very good at her job and is quite pleasant . When I arrived the place was rather full with customers , seemingly more woman than men . Several people were covered with the big hair drying bag over their head which makes me giggle . I was told to go right in the back where the men 's area is located and sat down for my hair cut . After having my hair washed by a helper I was soon seated at Sue 's chair and enjoyed our usual small talk while she cut my hair . We discussed recent weekend getaways and holiday family gatherings .|Who did they tip when she was done?|the helper|0

Last night , after finishing up the laundry for the week , I was dead tired and ready for bed . Unfortunately , I had removed the bed sheets from the bed to launder them . I had taken off the fitted sheet and the pillowcases and tossed them into the washer . So , I went to my closet and took out another bed sheet and pillow case set . I unfurled the fitted sheet and managed to get it around all four corners . I then took the pillowcases and put them on my two pillows . After finishing the bed sheet change , I passed out on my soft , comfortable , and now , clean bed for a night of sleep . Tomorrow morning , I will take out the drying sheets and pillowcase from the dryer , fold them and then put them in the closet that I got tonight 's new sheets from . Sleepy time .|When did they work on the bed sheets?|Last night before bed|1

It was time for my cat to eat her dinner . Her name is Gracie . When it 's time for her to eat , she will meow constantly and paw at her food bowl . When I noticed her doing this , I walked to the kitchen cabinet where her food is kept and pulled out one small can of tuna and chicken flavored wet cat food , which is her favorite . She saw that I did this and affectionately brushed up against my legs . I opened the can using the pull tab on top of the lid , and used a spoon to scrape all of the food out of the can and into her food dish . I also placed water into her water bowl , which she lapped up after finishing her cat food .|Who went to her dish?|The cat.|1

There are n't many inexpensive things to do in Seattle -- and that 's especially true if you 're a student . Finally , I found something online : a cheap trip to an art museum . I could n't book online , but I made a note to go in on Sunday . I paid for my ticket without hassle . Once everyone had their tickets , a guide met us and led the group through the museum . I saw lots of exhibits : paintings , sculptures , pottery , and more . There was so much to see in the museum . Even if I 'd stayed all day , there was no way I could have seen all of it . At the end of my trip , I went to the souvenir store and bought myself a few trinkets . It was great !|What day was the visit to the museum?|Sunday|1

We were invited to watch a race for `` track team '' , where my daughter was part of it . It was summer , but I was in hurry and did not realize to bring anything with me . When I reached there , I was already hungry and the people with me too .  So I decided to look for vendors or machine . I saw machines , and they were so many . It made me happy .  I had $ 10 with me .  They had some drinks which was for .50 , but big can and bottles . They were very reasonable . So I entered $ 10 in slot and pressed buttons for potato chips , Cheetos , Doritos , and Sun chips , total of $ 5 , and then I got 5 bottles of Gatorade , 2 bottles of water , Fanta , Pepsi .  Believe me it was enough for us .|What costs .50 each?|Drinks.|1

I am great at making drinks when someone comes over . Everyone I hang out with knows this . I know just how to properly do this . I always ask what my guest would like first . Then I get the ingredients to make the drink . I always keep lots of different ingredients in my kitchen . I get a glass and make the drink . I also add ice . I do n't like to serve a warm drink . I then deliver the drink . I 'm always ready to get a refill if my guest should want it . My guests have a good time when they have a good drink to enjoy . I have even gotten paid for doing this at a few gatherings in the past .|Who were sitting down?|The host|0

The other day I noticed that I was low on gas and had to fuel up my car . I pulled into the gas station with the pump on my driver 's side since that 's where my tank fills and turned off the car . The gas station I went to uses points that I earned at the grocery store so I entered my loyalty number and had 27 cents off a gallon which was great ! I swiped my debit card to pay and I popped the fuel door with a level inside my door and unscrewed the gas cap . I squeezed the handle and let the gas fill the tank until it automatically stopped because it was full . I carefully removed the nozzle from the fuel tank , replaced it on the pump and screwed the gas cap back on tightly and closed the fuel door . When I started my car to reset the trip meter and made note so I could see how many miles my car got per gallon since the last fill .|Where did they put the nozzle?|in the fuel tank|1

The restaurant was terrible again and I probably should not have given it another chance . The management at the store level is obviously not paying attention to me so it is time to right to headquarters . I opened the word processing program on my computer and opened a new document .  I went all the way to the right side and entered my street address on one line and the city , state and zip code below that .  Next I entered the date and then moved all the way to the left and entered the street address of the restaurant headquarters and the city , state and zip code of the headquarters .  I started the letter with Dear Sir and on the next lines , proceeded to explain the problems I had been having with this particular location , it 's service and food . I explained that I had tried to resolve it at store level but had been unsuccessful . On the final line , I went all the way to right and entered ` Sincerely ' and hit return a couple times , then added my name below that .  I folded it and put it an addressed and stamped envelope , and mailed it to the company headquarters .|What did they print out?|The receipt from the restaurant|0

It was a nice day outside.So me and my family were thinking about ordering food from a restaurant.Then at the same time we shouted out lets order food from a restaurant.I went in to the living room and got my phone from my purse and dialed my family 's favorite restaurant.A female 's voice answered so I gave her our orders . Then after we ordered I went back to my family who were sitting outside on our lovely porch.After a while of waiting . We got our food so we started eating but everything tasted so bad we had to send it back to the restaurant like now . So I just cooked but my whole family only helps me with dessert . After all this happening we still enjoyed the day .|When did the family give back the food?|after tasting the foods|1

I woke up early yesterday morning . I decided to make breakfast for the family . First I opened the fridge to see what we had . I took some bread out of the freezer . I pulled a pan from beneath the oven . I placed it on the front burner . I added 8 strips of bacon . I let the bacon cook on one side , and then I flipped the bacon . I allowed it to cook on the other side , and then I removed it . I then poured some of the bacon grease from the pan into a aluminum can . I heated the pan back up , and added the eggs . I let the eggs cook on one side until the whites were no longer runny .|When did they place the bacon and eggs and bread on a plate?|After it was cooked.|1

It is Sunday night at home , which means that tomorrow ( Monday ) the garbage will be picked up by the garbage truck . In my house , taking out the garbage is one of my son 's , Matthew , duties . Matthew first collects garbage from the garbage cans in all the rooms around the house ; the kitchen , bathrooms and bedrooms . As Matthew collects garbage from all the rooms , he also changes all the garbage bags that are used in the garbage cans . He then takes the big garbage bag and goes outside the house to put the bag full of garbage into the big outside garbage can . Finally , Matthew puts the big outside garbage can on the curve so that the garbage man will empty it into the garbage truck and haul it away to the landfill . Matthew takes out the garbage every Sunday and Wednesday since this is one of his assigned chores .|Who has to collect the garbage?|The son, Matthew.|1

As Matthew collects garbage from all the rooms , he also changes all the garbage bags that are used in the garbage cans . He then takes the big garbage bag and goes outside the house to put the bag full of garbage into the big outside garbage can . Finally , Matthew puts the big outside garbage can on the curve so that the garbage man will empty it into the garbage truck and haul it away to the landfill . Matthew takes out the garbage every Sunday and Wednesday since this is one of his assigned chores .|What does Matthew collect?|All the garbage in the house.|1

I got up this morning and got ready for work . I put on nice clothes and packed a lunch to take with me . I hurried to get out the door on time . I drove to work , going slowly because of the usual morning traffic . When I got to work , I pulled into the parking lot and found a parking space . My parking pass was already hanging from my rear-view mirror , showing that I was allowed to park in the building 's parking lot . I went into the break room and put my lunch in the refrigerator . Several people I work with said good morning , and I greeted them in return . Then I sat down at my desk and opened my email to see what I needed to do today .|Where did one go after getting out of the car?|home|0

Today I choose some ground beef to make hamburger patties for dinner . The leaner meat contains less fat but costs more . I choose to pay more today to purchase the leaner package of meat to make a healthier meal for myself . I picked a large heavy frying pan from my cabinet and put it on the front stove burner . I turned the heat knob to medium high and placed the raw patties in the pan to cook . After about seven minutes , I used a spatula to pick up a patty and check the underside . It appeared to be browned on the bottom so I flipped the patties over to cook on the other side . I used a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat . It read 165 so I knew my dinner was safe to eat . I set the table with buns , ketchup , mustard and pickles and sat down to eat a delicious hamburger .|How long was required for cooking?|Until temperature was 165|1

I was in search of a job , and created a resume to match my education , experience , and skills . I made sure that my resume was a reflection of who I was and what job I was looking for . I then went online to different websites that had job listings , and submit my resume to each posting that interested me . In addition to looking online , I printed copies of my resume and went to places that interested me to see if they were looking for anybody to hire . A few days later , I received a few e-mails from potential employers who wanted me to come in for an interview . I was very excited , and I hoped that my job search would soon be over and that one of the employers would hire me after meeting me .|When did they go somewhere in person?|after interviewing|0

My daughter had a bad headache and needed to take some medicine . First , I checked to make sure she did n't have a fever . After that I went to the bathroom and got the medicine out of the cabinet .  I then looked to see how much she could take and how often .

I brought the pills and water to her and she put the pills in her mouth and then took large drinks of water until she swallowed the pills .

I looked at the time to know when she could have more if she needed them .|When did it take effect?|30 minutes after taking it|1

Last night my brothers and I all had to be in different places at different times so we were n't able to eat dinner together . My mom decided to order a pizza because it was something we could grab and eat on the way . First , she asked us whether we 'd like pizza from Pizza Hut , Papa John 's or Domino 's . We picked Pizza Hut . The worker asked what we would like . Mom ordered two large pizzas : one plain cheese and one pepperoni . Then she was asked if we 'd like any drinks or breadsticks to go with it . Then we were told our order would be delivered in about 30 to 45 minutes . Mom hung up and told us to get ready to go . 30 minutes later , the pizza delivery person knocked on the door . She gave the driver $ 3 to keep for himself for delivering the pizza for us .

I was getting really nervous . My best friend had set me up on a blind date . I got to the restaurant early so that I could see her walk through the door . Was it her ? The young woman looked at me and smiled . She walked my way and called out my name . I smiled back , relieved that the worst part might be over . We ordered food and talked to each other as we ate . She and I really had a lot in common ! After dinner , I walked her to her apartment and she gave me her phone number and a good night kiss . I was so happy ! I wondered how I could have ever been worried when this was absolutely the best date I had ever had in my life !|Who walked in where?|narrator into the restaurant|1

I got up in the morning and my stomach was growling . I was really hungry , so I went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator and pulled out the eggs . I took a glass bowl out of the cupboard and cracked three eggs into the bowl . I added just a little bit of milk so my eggs would be nice and fluffy . Then , I took out a frying pan and turned on the stove . I greased the pan and added the egg mixture . I waited until they were cooked through and took them out of the pan and put them on my plate .

Last week , I went on a bike tour with my friends around the city . We 'd learned about it on the website , discussed , and agreed that it sounded like fun and we wanted to go . On the day of the tour , we woke up early , had a good breakfast , and got our bikes ready . There were many other people there we greeted and talked to . When it was time to start , we got on our bikes and began riding down the first trail through the woods and past the lakes . The weather was beautiful and there were many sights to see . The tour took us past the lakes and through green fields as well outside of the city , with pauses in-between to see the sights along the way and enjoy a nice fresh drink .|Where did someone go?|on a bike tour|1

Last weekend my dad and I decided to take a day to go fishing together at the local lake . We got into the car and headed to the lake . When we got there my dad rented a rowboat for us . Once we were in a good quiet spot on the lake , my dad took out our fishing poles and some worms for fishing bait . He put a worm at the end of my fishing hook and then told me to cast my fishing line into the lake . Once my fishing line was in the lake I waited and waited , but it seemed like there were no fish that were falling for my bait . I began reeling it in to find a fish that was 12 inches long ! My dad and I took it home so that mom could cook it for dinner .|Where do they feel a nibble?|as the line was being reeled in|0

My family wanted to take my sister and brother-in-law to dinner to celebrate their move to New York . My dad called me and asked me to go make a reservation . I drove to the Olive Garden and I walked into the restaurant . I told them that I wanted to make a reservation for a table for 9 people . They said that they could do that , but it would be a 10 minute wait . I told them that was fine and we waited for everyone to show up . After 10 minutes , a waiter took us back into the other room in order to enjoy a nice table . They sat us down and we waited until everyone was seated until we started to order drinks and any food that we were already hungry to start eating .|Where were the people at?|home|0

My children asked me if I would take them to the playground . I said yes , and began to get myself and my children ready to go out . First I went into the kitchen and got out a few juice boxes and bags of pre-cut fruit . Then I helped my children get their shoes on and double-checked that we had everything we need . I grabbed my purse and my car keys , and let my children out the door . I locked the door and got inside the car . I looked in the back seat and made sure my children had their seat belts on before I began to drive . Then I drove us to the playground . We walked to the playground and I told them that they had to stay where I could see them . I sat on a bench meant for parents watching their children and took out the lunch bag . I watched my children play and yelled that I had some snacks if they got hungry . About 2 hours later , when it was time to leave I told them that we had to go , and I grabbed my purse and went back to the car . I made sure they had their seat belts on and I drove us all home .|Where did they put the juice boxes and bags of pre-cut fruit?|In the kitchen|0

My children asked me if I would take them to the playground . I said yes , and began to get myself and my children ready to go out . First I went into the kitchen and got out a few juice boxes and bags of pre-cut fruit . Then I helped my children get their shoes on and double-checked that we had everything we need . I grabbed my purse and my car keys , and let my children out the door . I locked the door and got inside the car . I looked in the back seat and made sure my children had their seat belts on before I began to drive . Then I drove us to the playground . We walked to the playground and I told them that they had to stay where I could see them . I sat on a bench meant for parents watching their children and took out the lunch bag . I watched my children play and yelled that I had some snacks if they got hungry . About 2 hours later , when it was time to leave I told them that we had to go , and I grabbed my purse and went back to the car .

Visiting the beach is fun . Sometimes a beach is close and I can walk to it . Sometimes I drive to a beach far away . Today I am going to a beach near me but I have to drive to . I am going to take everything I need to have fun at the beach : sunglasses , towel , swim suit , sun screen and food and something to drink . When I get to the beach I have to find a place to the things I brought . Usually I get into the ocean water and swim all around . Or other times I play in the waves . This makes me hungry and I eat the food I brought , then take a nap on my towel .|What do they lay on the beach far from the water?|Sand|0

Today , I decided to write a letter to my best friend . I sat down at my desk and opened the drawer to find my favorite stationary and pen . I 'm left handed , so when I started writing , I got a few smudges from the pen on my hand . My friend lives in Arizona , so in my letter , I asked about the weather and how her summer has been going . I know it has been very hot in Arizona , so I told her to stay cool and use sunscreen . My friend lives in Arizona and I live in Mississippi , so I had to mail it . I addressed the envelope and put a stamp on it . I washed the smudges from my hand and carried the letter to my mailbox so the mailman could pick it up the next day .|When did they put the letter into the envelope to send?|right before they addressed the envelope and put a stamp on it|1

I recently took a taxi when I was staying with a friend in Chicago . The city is very busy , and parking can be hard to find , so it is often easier to take a taxi to get to place to place . We had decided to go to dinner and see a play . We walked to a street where taxis often go past , and waved to show the driver that we wanted a ride . I told the driver the name and address of the Thai restaurant my friend and I had planned to go to . He was familiar with the location and we started to travel . On he way , the driver told us that he also enjoyed Thai food and recommended the green curry at that restaurant . As we were driving , I could see how much the cost of the trip would be as a screen displayed a slowly increasing cost . We got to our destination , and I paid the driver the fee on the screen along with a small tip .|What did the people get in?|A taxi|1

When my wife and I get home from the grocery store , sometimes we get my stepson to come out and help us pull them out of the trunk of the car . Then We take them upstairs to our kitchen and set all of the bags on the kitchen floor . Then we just grab whatever bag we want and start trying to find a place for them . Then we place stuff like cans , boxed cereals , boxed rice , in one particular cabinet . Then we put away all the refrigerated stuff like cheese , milk , eggs , lunch meat in the lower portion of the fridge . Then of course , we do the frozen on top , like frozen pizzas , meat patties , chicken breasts and ice cream . Then we put stuff that we ca n't fit anywhere else on our counter top , like bags of chips or fruit .|Where was room being made?|The trunk of the car.|0

Yesterday the dishes were piling up . First , I turned on the warm water to rinse the dishes . The water warmed up slowly so I loaded some of the dishes that did n't need to be rinsed first into the dishwasher . Some of the dishes require soap and scrubbing with the sponge to get off the caked dried food . I knew those dishes would n't be cleaned by the dishwasher if I did n't do this . After I loaded the dishwasher I put the dishwasher detergent inside the detergent door . I then started the dishwasher so they dishes could be washed . After this I had to finish washing the dishes that could not be washed in the dishwasher . I finished the dishes and waited for the dishwasher to finish so I could put the dishes away .|When did they rinse the rest of the dishes one by one?|After dishwasher finished|0

When I walked into the store , I did n't notice that the register up front was not taking cash , the whole reason I had come into the store in the first place . After grabbing a couple of candy bars , I made my way to the front of the store and up to the register . When I got there , I noticed the sign stating that cash was not currently being taken . Reluctantly , I pulled out my debit card , not remembering that I had just used the last of the money available on it on groceries . I searched through my wallet and finally found my credit card . I had just gotten a credit limit increase , so I was positive that it would not be declined . Thankfully , I was correct and I left the store with my candy bars , but not able to break the cash I had .|What did the cashier give them?|cash|0

My dad and I decided to go to a football game on Saturday . We got into the car and drove to the football stadium . We had to wait in line for a little while because a lot of people were going to the game . When we got to the front of the line , we handed our tickets to someone and they let us in . I ordered a hot dog , some nachos and a Sprite . My dad had popcorn , a hamburger and a Coke . We were cheering for the Buckeyes to win . At halftime , we went to the bathroom . The lines were really long , so we did n't get to hear the band play . Even though we cheered for the Buckeyes , they still lost . After the game was over , we went home . I had a lot of fun .|What was bought in the stadium?|Tickets|0

When I woke up this morning , I decided that the first I was going to do was to take a shower and wash my hair . I did n't want to get my clothes wet , so I undressed and stepped into the shower . I turned the water on and waited to the side until the water warmed up . After my hair was wet , I reached down and grabbed the shampoo that I was currently using . It ran out , so I reached for another one . I put the liquid in my hands and started rubbing them together . I let the soap sit in my hair for a few minutes before I dunked my head under the water to make it all wash off of me .|When was their hands foamy?|before getting in the shower.|0

There was a par three course where I went to with two of my friends . I did not have clubs . But I won the game only borrowing two of their clubs , a butter and a wedge . The wedge was great . It was a close game . I needed to get a par on the last hole to win , and I did . I did the fist pump like Tiger Woods when I won the game . It was 8 dollars . You just put in the money in some box . There was n't anyone there to make sure you payed . It was 9 holes total . It was a sunny day . And one of my friends is usually a better golfer than I am .|When did they start to compete?|before waking|0

When I was young , my family got a dog named Sunny . We picked him up when he was just 12 weeks old and still a puppy . We immediately began our training with him , first up was potty training . Once he did so , he was rewarded a treat for his good behavior . Overnight , he stayed in his crate which was made smaller . It is said if dogs have a confined space they will not go to the bathroom since it will soil their immediate surroundings . The next three commands we taught Sunny were to sit , shake , and stay . He was a quick learner . Treats helped immensely for training the dog to follow these commands .|Who knew there would be a reward?|The cat|0

My nieces and nephews have too many toys . They pull them all out at once and spread them over the house . I let them do this throughout the day because there is not point in trying to clean until they 're too tired to pull out any more toys . We go from room to room gathering all the toys . Then I make them decide where each thing should go . They have to remember which bin , closet , bedroom , cabinet , etc each toy came from . Then we place them all back as neatly as we can . Everything has a place . Once the toys are back in their appropriate places I give everyone a gold star . And maybe a cookie . Because I 've earned it .|When did they say something?|The nieces and nephews were told to order cooffee.|0

The crying told me that the baby was hungry . I grabbed a prepared bottle from the refrigerator filled with formula . I prepare about 6-8 bottles ahead of time and place in the refrigerator so the baby does n't have to wait long for food when hungry . I can control the temperature and it is safer than microwaving for the baby . After testing a drop or two of warmed formula on my wrist , to make sure it is n't too cold or hot , it is time to pick up the baby and feed them . I hold the baby in my arms as they longingly look into my eyes . After about fifteen minutes the baby is n't drinking anymore . I put them over my shoulder and rub their back in order for them to burp . I then prop them up in their baby seat so as not to choke .|When does the author clean the bottle?|when the baby is hungry|0

When I was sixteen , I started to take lessons in driving . I took them from my teacher and had a class with him before I took any lessons in a car . He would tell us about what to do at a stop sign and other rules that we follow on the road . After I had studied hard , I took a test that said I was ready to get into a car . When I went to my first driving lesson , I was nervous that I would crash , but my teacher told me to relax . We went on streets and even the freeway ! It was hard to get used to , but I started to feel more comfortable before too long . We drove back to the school and my teacher gave me a score on how I had done .|When did they turn the key?|before getting into the car|0

We drove back to the school and my teacher gave me a score on how I had done .|who told them to drive?|The teacher|1
When I was sixteen , I started to take lessons in driving . I took them from my teacher and had a class with him before I took any lessons in a car . He would tell us about what to do at a stop sign and other rules that we follow on the road . After I had studied hard , I took a test that said I was ready to get into a car .

My neighbors went out of town and they asked me to take care of their cats . They told me that they would have to eat tomato soup every day while they were gone . I met the cats the next day and there were over 5 of them .  I got out the tomato soup cans that were given to me and opened them up for the cats . I poured the soup into a bowl for each of the five cats . They looked at me for a second in gratitude and then began to eat from each of their bowls .  They must 've been hungry to have eaten so fast ! After they were done , I washed each bowl with some warm water so it would be clean again .|What did they all have?|bowls|1

I have been playing football my entire life . Yesterday , we played a football game . I had a lot of fun since it was a close game . I scored the first six points of the game this way , and the play was very easy . The next time we tried to use this same play , it was n't so easy . The other team caught on to what we were trying to do and actually got the ball from us and scored 6 points ! We then pushed them back so that we could score another 6 points with a touchdown , and our kicker got us an extra 2 points . I love playing football because it gives me a chance to hang out with my friends and be active at the same time . We are all very good at football !|What was run down the field?|the football|1

Every week one must do laundry . It is important to do it to keep your clothes clean so that you do not smell . Doing laundry is pretty simple . I had to go to the washing machine , put the necessary settings on the washing machine , and wait until it was finish washing . It was a boring wait , but I had to wait so that I could put them in the dryer to of course wait some more . This is the easiest way to do it though , I could have hand washed them and hung them up to dry but I bet that takes even longer . Who wants to be dressed in dirty clothes after all ? Anyways , when I was done doing my laundry I went back to my day , happy to have finished a chore !|Doing laundry is what type of chore?|a difficult one|0

Yesterday after school I decided that I would like to play some music over my computer speakers . I turned on my computer and opened the music player . I then looked through the album collection on my computer to find a band that I felt like listening to .  Finally , I decided to play a song on an album by one of my favorite musicians ever , Michael Jackson .  I double clicked on the song title and turned up the volume on my speakers . Once the song came on I started dancing around the room to the beat . When the song ended I was pretty tired from dancing , so I clicked on the pause button and exited out of the music player .|Why did they leave the computer on?|in case they wanted to listen to more music|1

Every Sunday , when I was young , my family would drive up to Cleveland to visit my grandmother . My mom usually was n't up when I woke up , but I was so excited I would go and wake her up . Soon she would have us all gathered in the car and ready to go . After about an hour 's drive , we would be there . My grandma would make all kinds of sweets and let me watch all kinds of movies and such that I would also want to go up more than that . She used to make the best cookies and cakes a kid could ever hope for . Stuff you probably did n't even know existed . She also had lots of comics from throughout the years that I 'm sure my aunts and uncles collected when they were young .|And what else did grandma have?|Cakes and cookies|1

It really takes patience when it comes to feeding a infant . It was time for me to feed my baby . She was crying because she was hungry . It is much easier to feed baby in car seat , because you can rock it at same time to sooth them too . I put the bib around her neck , and i made sure it is big enough , because it always make mass , I grabbed baby food which I purchased from grocery store . It was peach and banana . She smiled , I was happy that she liked it , because first time i introduced her this flavor . I opened another bottle , that is zucchini and peas . Alternatively I gave that too , just to give more change of taste . I gave her water time to time . She calmed down very quickly and finished her food ,|Why did she keep a sippy cup?|To give the infant soda.|0

It 's Saturday and its cleaning day in my house . I usually have a busy work week and do n't have time to deep clean my house . So I take Saturday of each week to clean my house , in every nook and cranny I clean until it shines .  I take extra care in cleaning it and keeping it clean . I even bought a special vacuum that specializes in vacuuming carpets to look like they are new . When I get to the vacuuming part of my cleaning routine , I take out my vacuum and plug it into the wall .  Then I take the vacuum to my carpet and start to vacuum all the area ; making sure to not leave any spot .  I like clean lines and the fresh look vacuuming leaves my carpet so I make sure no to step over what I freshly vacuumed . Then I continue to vacuum all of my house , until all of the carpet in my house is vacuumed .|What do they plan to do to the carpet?|Vacuum|1

I made a sandwich for lunch today . I really wanted a ham and cheese sandwich but I actually only had turkey and cheese , so that 's what I ended up making . I put the bread in the toaster and when it popped up , I put the cheese on first so that it could melt a little bit . Then I put the second piece of toast on top . After that , I cut the sandwich into two using a knife . I like to cut my sandwiches into two triangles , so I cut it in half in that direction rather than into two rectangles . A turkey and cheese sandwich is a nutritious way to have lunch , and it was a good way to get my protein and calcium for the day .|What meal was the sandwich for?|dinner|0

After that , I cut the sandwich into two using a knife . I like to cut my sandwiches into two triangles , so I cut it in half in that direction rather than into two rectangles . A turkey and cheese sandwich is a nutritious way to have lunch , and it was a good way to get my protein and calcium for the day .|What was eaten by the person?|the turkey and cheese sandwich|1

Last night I wanted to make a drink for myself . After I decided which drink I would have I went to the kitchen to make it . First , I got the glass out of the cupboard and rinsed it out to remove any dust that might have collected inside . I went then went to the fridge and got out the ingredients for the drink and arranged them in order on the countertop . Next , I went to the cupboard and got a spoon to stir the drink with . After that , I poured the ingredients into the cup in the proper amounts and stirred everything to mix it all up . Then I tasted the drink to make sure it was how I liked it . When I was satisfied with everything I put the ingredients back where I got them from and sat down to enjoy the tasty drink I had just created .|Where did the cup get put?|countertop|1

Yesterday I served a meal to my friends . We were all very hungry , and I 'm a good cook . For those reasons , we all decided to go to the store together and pitch in to buy some food . After we had all the food we needed , we went back to my house and I began to prepare the ingredients . Then , I began to cook the chicken . Chicken Marsala is also served with pasta noodles , so after a while I boiled the pasta so that it would be ready by the time the chicken was . Once both items were ready , I put them onto plates and carried the plates over to the dinner table where my friends were sitting . We all sat down together and enjoyed the great meal , washing our own dishes after we 'd all finished .|When did they make Chicken Marsala?|during the get-together|1

I just graduated from school and need to find a job so I can be independent and take care of myself . The first thing I need to do is write a resume . I am not sure how to do this so I asked my parents for some help . We talked about this for a while . Then she sat down with me at the kitchen table and we created my resume together . She made me do most of the work though , telling me that she was so proud of me . I know that I would n't be qualified for anything more than that so I was being realistic . After scanning the listings for entry level positions , I saw one that sounded really good . It was an interesting company and they wanted someone who had the skills that I have . I sent my resume online , as they asked , and hoped for a call to set up a time for my interview . I was very nervous . A day or two went by and I keep sending resumes to different places . On the third day I got a text message asking me to call the first company I sent my resume to . A very nice man answered . I told him I was calling in response to his email to set up an appointment for an interview . He said he was looking forward to meeting me and asked if tomorrow was convenient for me . I was so excited , but I stayed calm and told him that , thank you , it would be very convenient . He was very nice and spoke with me for quite a while . At the end of our meeting he told me he did n't have to look any further , I was hired . I could n't believe it . I felt so happy and lucky at the same time .

She made me do most of the work though , telling me that she was so proud of me . I know that I would n't be qualified for anything more than that so I was being realistic . After scanning the listings for entry level positions , I saw one that sounded really good . It was an interesting company and they wanted someone who had the skills that I have . I sent my resume online , as they asked , and hoped for a call to set up a time for my interview . I was very nervous . A day or two went by and I keep sending resumes to different places . On the third day I got a text message asking me to call the first company I sent my resume to . A very nice man answered . I told him I was calling in response to his email to set up an appointment for an interview . He said he was looking forward to meeting me and asked if tomorrow was convenient for me . I was so excited , but I stayed calm and told him that , thank you , it would be very convenient . He was very nice and spoke with me for quite a while . At the end of our meeting he told me he did n't have to look any further , I was hired . I could n't believe it . I felt so happy and lucky at the same time . I had my first job !|When did they call the number that was given?|Immediately after writing the resume|0

I called to my dog and got the leash off of the hook on the hall . My dog came quickly and I attached his leash to his collar . I put my phone and house keys into my pocket . I walked with my dog to the park across the street from out house and went to the paved walking path . We walked the length of the walking path twice . I listed to my dog to make sure he was n't getting overheated . I greated people we passed by . I made sure that my dog did not approach anyone who did not want to pet my dog by keeping a firm hold of his leash .

I like to cook a lot but I am not a very good baker . So I never bake cakes from scratch . However I do like cake a lot so I do bake them . I use box mixes . it really does n't take much time . All you need to do is get one bowl . Add the cake mix from the box . Then a half cup of oil and finally about a cup of water . Then you need to get your mixer and put it on medium and mix it all up for 2 to 3 minutes . Then put it into a non stick cake pan and bake for about 30 minutes . So all together about 10 minutes preparation and 30 minutes baking you can have a good tasting cake in 40 minutes . .|What ar they waiting to cool?|the cake after baking|1

I had adopted a new dog and realized he needed lots of training . I got a book about dog training and read it so that I could understand how to train my dog the right way . I went to the pet store and bought some of his favorite dog treats . I first trained him to respond to the command " sit " and " stay " by giving him a treat every time he obeyed the command . After a while , he started obeying the command even without getting a treat in return . Over the next few days , I trained my dog to respond to different commands by gradually working up to more complicated commands like lay down , fetch , and retrieve . Training my dog took lots of patience on my part , and lots of hard work from my dog , but it was worth it .|Who did they take outside and begin a training session with?|Their new dog|1

Last night my air conditioner stopped working . It was so hot and sweaty while I was sleeping . It was clear when I woke up that I was going to have to change my sheets ! I took them all to the laundry room . I placed the into the washing machine . I added the proper amount of liquid laundry detergent . I closed the lid and let it wash . After it was done , I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet . They took an hour to dry . I placed the fitted sheet on , as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on . I then put the flat sheet on , the blankets on the pillow cases on and top a moment to lay on top of the fresh bedding and just smell it for a minute . That is the best smell in the world .|What goes over the pillows?|pillow cases|1

I took them all to the laundry room . I placed the into the washing machine . I added the proper amount of liquid laundry detergent . I closed the lid and let it wash . After it was done , I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet . They took an hour to dry . I placed the fitted sheet on , as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on . I then put the flat sheet on , the blankets on the pillow cases on and top a moment to lay on top of the fresh bedding and just smell it for a minute .

Sometimes i like to sew clothes for special occasions . I really like to sew Halloween costumes . The first thing i do is go to a fabric store to pick out a pattern . After I choose a fun pattern that i like , I can pick the fabric right away . At the same store I get the thread to match my fabric and if I need buttons or zippers , they are in the same store , too . The patterns are made of folded paper so when i get ready to start , i spread the fabric out in a big area near my sewing machine and place the paper patterns on top and pin them together . After all of the pieces are cut and i put my new thread in my sewing machine , I can start sewing the pieces of my costume together .|Pinning the paper and fabric together makes it easier to cut what out with their scissors?|The patterns.|1

I am getting ready for vacation to the beach so I need to pack my suitcase . I start by putting my shoes into plastic bags and sitting them in the bottom of the suitcase . I then packed shorts by folding them and putting them in a pile on top the shoes . My shirts and sundresses I folded into thirds lengthwise and rolled them up like a sleeping bag ; by packing them this way they will not get wrinkled as easily and it is easy to fit more into the suitcase . I put all of my toiletries like shampoo , sunscreen and toothbrush into a plastic bag in case they would leak and into a special toiletry bag and put that in the top of the suitcase . I added two beach towels to the very top to cover everything in the suitcase . I easily closed and zipped the suitcase and was ready to go .|What did they fold together?|shirts and shorts|0

I went in to my child 's school to volunteer . They were having story time ! I brought a book to read to them . I sat down in front of the classroom and opened the book . I started to read . I read slowly so that they would be able to follow along . It had very bright pictures in it ! There were some very funny parts , and they laughed and laughed when something silly happened . It was a long story , and it took about thirty minutes to read the entire story . It felt so nice telling the story to them . I love books , and I could tell that they really enjoyed it . My daughter was very happy , especially because it was also her birthday !|What was on the pages with the words?|Bright pictures.|1

I brought home a new poster and I wanted to put it on the wall . I went into the kitchen and got some double stick tape . I then brought the tape to my room . I took one piece of tape and put it in one corner . I then repeated the process for all four corners of the poster . I then took the poster in my hands , and held it up to the wall without sticking it to the wall , just making sure I placed it in the perfect spot . When I found the spot I wanted the poster , I pressed the corners with the tape onto the wall to make sure they would stick . I would now be able to always look at the poster on my wall whenever I wanted to !|When was the poster perfectly in place?|After holding the poster up|1

I always thought cooking is very easy until my mum told me to cook meat this fateful day . After washing the meat with clean water I lit the stove and put clean pot on it and I pour clean water inside . I cut some onion inside the empty pot add some other ingredient in the pot and pour the meat inside before adding salt . After like 15 minutes , I opened the pot , the meat has already been boiled when I tasted it I realized it now really so soft and good to eat but since I do n’t want my mum to punish me I only eat some just some part of the meat . I put frying pan on fire . Added some oil after some time when I realized the oil was very hot I decided to put the meat on fire . The colour of the meat changed to dark brown as it fries I really enjoyed looking at it been fried and the noise it was making .|What did mum tell them to do to the meat?|Cook the meat.|1

Yesterday , I ordered pizza for dinner but I ended up having a few slices leftover , so I stuck them in the fridge . Today , I decided to have one of those slices of pizza for lunch . I took the pizza box out of the fridge and put it on the counter .  I took one of the pizza slices and placed it on the paper plate . I decided I wanted my pizza warmed up , so I opened up the microwave door . Then I took the plate with the pizza and put it inside the microwave .  I pressed the button that corresponded to a 30 second microwave time and watched as the plate spun around inside the microwave .  I opened up the microwave door and took out my pizza . It was warm and ready to be eaten !|What stopped spinning and beeped?|The microwave.|1

When I was young , my mom asked me to set the dinner room table . She had taught me where to put the cup , plates , spoon , fork , knife , and bowls . I got out all of the items for the 9 people that were in my family . We put the plates down first and then put the forks and spoons . We filled up the cups last with water and some with lemonade . We put the cups back on the table and got all of the food out that my mom needed . We then got on the intercom and called everyone that was in my family to get upstairs and to eat dinner with the rest of us there .|When did they and their older brother get out spoons and forks?|After eating|0

I got out all of the items for the 9 people that were in my family . We put the plates down first and then put the forks and spoons . We filled up the cups last with water and some with lemonade . We put the cups back on the table and got all of the food out that my mom needed .

I decided that I wanted to learn how to swim so i took a swimming class . I first looked online to see where I could take a class . I found out that my local gym offered swimming classes on the weekend .  They told me it would be 50 dollars and that it would start at 10 am this upcoming Friday . I showed up to the gym with my bathing suit and the 50 dollars . Once I paid them had everyone get in the pool and tread water .  Then the teacher showed us how to do all different types of strokes such as the backstroke and the butterfly .  At the end of the class we had a competition to see who could hold their breath for the longest and I did so for 30 seconds .|Who did they call?|the swimming teacher|0

I was bored last night and I did not want to go out . I got myself some snacks and sat on the couch . I turned on the television and flipped through the channels . I decided to look at the movies that were for rent through my cable provider . Some of the movies that were for rent cost way too much money . Some of the movies you could only buy and they were n't even available to rent . It was hard for me to decide between the movies that were available , so I watched free previews for a couple of the movies . I pushed the button that said `` rent '' and I confirmed that I wanted to rent it . A message on the screen said I had access to the movie for the next 24 hours . I watched the movie right then , and it was pretty good .|When did they realize they didn't find anything they wanted to watch on the channels?|After flipping through them|1

It was Friday , the day I decided to clean my house . I thought I should start in the kitchen and tidy up in there first . After I put away my dishes , and wiped down the counters , I wanted to make sure the floor was nice and clean .  First , I got out my broom and dust pan .  I moved all of the furniture out of the way and carefully swept up any debris or dirt off of the linoleum floor .  Then , I got out my bucket and filled it with hot water and soap . I then went into the storage closet and grabbed my mop . I put the mop in the bucket of water and got it nice and wet .  Afterwards , I let the floor dry and put all of the chairs and things I had previously moved back into their rightful spots .|Where did they sweep the dirt?|In the closet|0

I moved all of the furniture out of the way and carefully swept up any debris or dirt off of the linoleum floor .  Then , I got out my bucket and filled it with hot water and soap . I then went into the storage closet and grabbed my mop . I put the mop in the bucket of water and got it nice and wet .  Afterwards , I let the floor dry and put all of the chairs and things I had previously moved back into their rightful spots .|What did they dump into the garbage can?|cans|0
Yesterday when dinnertime came , I started to crave a delicious hamburger . I already had hamburger buns , cheese , ketchup , and ground beef . The only thing I had to do was cook the meat . Once the saucepan was very hot , I put just enough meat in it to make a hearty hamburger . The meat started to sizzle as it cooked . After a few minutes , I knew it was time to flip it over and cook the other side . I used a spatula to flip it over . The side that was already cooked looked perfect ! After a few more minutes of sizzling , I knew that the second side was done as well and that my hamburger was ready to eat . Before I started eating , I made sure to turn off the stove .|When did the cook turn on the heat?|Before placing the pan|0

I was looking in the mirror yesterday and noticed that my hair was too long , so I decided to get a haircut . I called my regular salon to see if they were busy . Luckily , they were not and I was told to come right in . I was told to take a seat and that someone would be with me shortly . I was only seated for a few minutes when the hairdresser said that she was ready for me . She led me over to a chair and I sat down . We discussed what I wanted to do with my hair , a trim , and then she took me to the shampoo area . She combed my hair out and then cut off the split ends a few small sections at a time . I saw little wisps of my hair fall onto the floor . When the hairdresser was finished cutting , she took out a blow dryer and dried my hair . I walked back over to the receptionist and paid for the cut . I added about twenty percent as a tip to reward the hairdresser for doing a great job . I left the hair salon and drove home .|What were they pleased with|blow dryer|0

Yesterday , my best friend and I decided that we wanted to play some tennis . There is a tennis court outside of our apartment clubhouse , so we decided to rent some tennis racquets and balls from our clubhouse . We first met up at the clubhouse to pick up the racquets and balls . I changed into a tennis skirt and put on some tennis shoes . My friend changed into athletic clothes as well and put on a tennis visor . We then went to the tennis court with our gear . We volleyed the ball back and forth for a while , and I felt proud that my tennis skills had n't gotten rusty . After we 'd played for an hour , a couple joined us and asked if we wanted to play doubles . We ended up playing for another two hours !|How long did it take to agree?|not long|1

Every Saturday I do a chore I actually really enjoy - grocery shopping ! This past Saturday was no exception , so I began to plan my outing . I always begin by surveying my refrigerator and cabinets .  What food do I already have and what do I need ?  At this point I begin to make a written list to bring with . This week I also had a birthday party to shop for so extras like cake mix and a can of frosting went on my list . Once the list was done I headed to the store .  It 's a short drive , and once there I grabbed a cart and begin to head down the aisles .  After that on to dairy and dried goods , and even cleaning products . Finally it was off to the frozen aisles , I needed to get ice cream for the party ! With a full cart I went to the cash register , loaded all the food on the convener belt , and then paid for the groceries as a boy bagged everything .  Another Saturday 's chore was done !|In what order do they shop for their items?|ice cream, dairy and dried foods, cleaning products|0

One day my mother took me out to a bowling alley to spend time with my family and it was a new experience for me since I usually never go out and get socially active with people , But once I was out there long enough and started to loosen up and have fun with my family it was a very fun experience and we all laughed and joked around . We had a team battle where all the girls took on the boys at one point my team being the boys were down and we needed a major comeback and eventually what happened was I was able to bring the boys back into the game . Finally the game came down to one last move , If I got a strike we would win and if I did n't we would lose and surprisingly I was able to get the strike and get my team the win !|When was it fun?|Right away.|0

I needed to find an apartment , which some people call a flat . I found one that is in the location in town that is good for me and is in my price range and I have met with the manager and signed a move-in rental agreement that shows we agree on things like when I 'll pay and how much each month and other rules I will abide by . In preparation for moving I carefully pack my belongings into boxes , keeping them organized by which room they will go into in the new apartment . It takes several trips to move the boxes and all my old furniture and I need to use a truck and have people help me carry it all . Then I unpack everything and place all my items where they go .|Where were the belongings put in?|Into boxes.|1

In preparation for moving I carefully pack my belongings into boxes , keeping them organized by which room they will go into in the new apartment . It takes several trips to move the boxes and all my old furniture and I need to use a truck and have people help me carry it all . Then I unpack everything and place all my items where they go .|When will the move be?|on moving day|1

My little dog Rosie likes to wake up early in the morning to get a walk in . When she scratches at the door , I know it 's time for me to take her out . I pet her and put on her leash so that she wo n't run away . We will walk across the neighborhood and see other dogs along the way . Rosie will bark sometimes and I have to ask her to be quiet so that she does n't wake all of the neighbors up . She listens to me . Whenever she poops , I have to use a bag to clean it up so that she will not have her poop all over our neighbor 's yards . I like to take her home when it 's all over .|When do they take her for a walk?|when Rosie stops barking|0

On Sunday morning I decided to go visit a church that my friend attended . The church is very close to my house so I was able to sleep in a little bit before I had to leave . When I got to the church , my first thought was about how small the building was , but when I went inside I could see that it was much bigger than it appeared .  When the service started , I got a little nervous , because this church is different from the church I usually attend . I did not know the prayers , hymns , and did not know when to sit , kneel and stand . It did not matter .  People around me were very helpful , and I figured out that if I watched the people around the altar , I could figure out what I needed to do .  I loved all of the ceremony and the formality of the service . When it was over , I thanked my friend for inviting me . I hope to attend again soon .|What was simple and beautiful?|the drive over|0

I was so excited to be moving into my new flat . There was something so full of potential about moving into a new place . Of course there is a lot of work involved in moving . I asked a few friends and family to help me move . I invited my friends over for a packing party . While they were helping me box up all the things in my old flat , I ordered pizza and had drinks and dessert too . When it came time to move everything I asked my parents and sisters to help me move the boxes from the moving truck I had driven to the new place up through the elevator to their resting spots in my flat . They were glad to help me .|Where was everything put?|outside the flat on the sidewalk|0

Today , I helped my mom empty the kitchen sink . The sink was full of a lot of dishes , so the first thing we did was made sure they were all clean . The clean dishes I helped her put away , and some dishes that still looked dirty we decided to wash again . The way we washed them was to rinse them all off first with warm water , then soap them up with a sponge . My mom did most of the washing , and after each dish was washed I would rinse and dry it . I like that part the best , because it is rewarding to see all the clean dishes in the cabinet that we worked so hard to empty out of the sink . The empty kitchen sink then had to be cleaned with soap and water too ! So we scrubbed it down , and finally we were done .|What did they and their mom use to get tough stains out?|a towel|0

Yesterday , my friend and I went for a walk . First , we decided where we would like to go . He suggested the park near my house . Next , we checked the weather . We put on our walking shoes , then we headed out on our walk to the park . We stopped at the cross walk and waited for the signal to cross to be safe . The park is about 4 blocks away . We stayed on the sidewalk the whole time . Lots of people were walking dogs . There were lots of birds there too , singing in the trees . When we were finished enjoying the park , we headed home .

We stayed on the sidewalk the whole time . Lots of people were walking dogs . There were lots of birds there too , singing in the trees . When we were finished enjoying the park , we headed home . It was a nice walk .|When was the sun going down?|yesterday|0

This afternoon I went to the grocery store and bought a week 's worth of groceries . After I brought all of the grocery bags inside the house , I decided to put them away as soon as possible so that I could relax for a while . First I put every bag on the dining room table , then I began emptying the bags one by one . I organized every item in the bags on the counter in the following categories : fridge items , kitchen pantry items , freezer items , storage pantry items , and cupboard items . I put all of the freezer items away first so that they would n't begin to thaw out , then I put everything that needed to go in the fridge away so it would n't spoil . Then I put the kitchen pantry and storage pantry items away , before finally putting the cupboard items in their proper place . I double checked to make sure that I had all the groceries put away , and then I took all of the plastic bags and put them in a storage bin where I keep plastic bags from stores . I like to reuse them when I can .|When was everything organized?|before putting the groceries away|1

Today is Saturday , and I just woke up . I was feeling very hungry , so after my morning shower , I decided to go to the kitchen . I opened the fridge , and saw that we had a lot of lettuce , cheese , and mayonnaise . We even had pickles ! After checking our cupboards and realizing we had a lot of bread , I decided that my breakfast would be a big , nice sandwich . The great thing about sandwiches , is that you can put almost anything on a piece of bread and it will taste so different every time depending on what you put on it ! I rinsed off the lettuce , and placed it on top of the mayonnaise , followed by cheese and pickles . I squeezed some mayonnaise on top of the bread acting as a lid , too , before I smushed them together . Now I had made my breakfast sandwich .|What was squeezed on the brad?|mayonnaise|1

Today my nephew came to visit at my apartment . He is 5 years old and very active . His mom brought over his favorite toys to play with .  He was so excited to show me what toys he had and had a blast when I played along with him and his toys . After a few hours him and his mom had to leave for the day . Me and his mom had to clean up all the toys that were scattered all over the floor .  It seemed to take longer picking up the toys rather then taking them out to play with . After we were done picking up the toys my nephew gave me a big hug and told me how much fun he had with me and then they left .|How long did he play with all the toys?|A few minutes|0

Me and his mom had to clean up all the toys that were scattered all over the floor .  It seemed to take longer picking up the toys rather then taking them out to play with . After we were done picking up the toys my nephew gave me a big hug and told me how much fun he had with me and then they left .|What took quite a while?|Taking the toys out|0

I was spending time with a friend on a rainy day . We were both bored , and suddenly the idea came to her that we should go to a movie . We used our phones to Google the nearest theaters . We live in a city and do n't have a car , so we had to go somewhere that we could walk or take public transportation to . We decided on an AMC theater that shows about 15 different movies . She asked me if I wanted to see something in 3D , but unfortunately wearing the glasses makes me dizzy sometimes , so I said no . She asked if I wanted to see a comedy or and action movie . I usually prefer comedies , but then we realized that it was only showing once that day , and it was n't until much later . We knew it would take us about 30 minutes to get there , so we decided on an action movie that started in and hour and 15 minutes .|What were they happy about since they were bored?|Seeing a movie|1

When my neighbor 's cat bit my son , he got an infection . We went to the doctor , and he said some cat bites can be very dangerous . He prescribed an antibiotic , and said Rory had to take them all , one pill twice a day for ten days . I tried washing them down with a whole glass of water , but he said it felt they stuck in his throat , and he was drowning . I tried giving him a pill in a spoon , all covered with applesauce , but he said it tasted terrible . Finally I told him he should decide how to take his pills , and I would watch him take each one , since he needed to take them all . Then he took just a sip of water . `` Nothing to it mom , '' he said .|When did Rory agree?|when he had a choice how to take the pills|1

A few days ago , my son 's room was very messy . There were toys all over the floor , so I decided to have him clean it all up . We started by picking up all of the toys off of the floor and putting them in his toy box . We put these back together and and put them away in the game closet . He picked up his books and put them back on the bookshelf . I helped him put his crayons back in their box and put away his other art supplies that were on his desk . We both made his bed together . He put all of his dirty laundry away in the hamper or folded up the clothes that were clean and put them in the dresser . He also helped by dusting all of his shelves .|When was the floor cleared?|They picked up all of the toys off of the floor first|1

I first found a dollar bill in my pocket . I walked over to the vending machine and looked through the window to make sure I knew what I wanted . There were many rows of candy , snacks , and drinks to choose from I chose a particular candy bar and looked at the letter and number below it .  I then touched the letter and number on the keypad . The metal arms that held the candy bar in place pushed forward and the machine dropped my candy bar down into a place where I could reach through a door to pick it up . The machine knew that I put too much money in and I heard the sound of coins falling into a slot on the machine , which I used to hand to remove .|When did the next person use it?|While the writer purchased a vending machine snack|0

The two workmen laid plastic on the floor to protect it . Each person was dressed in old clothes and gathered the tools they would need . They brought a screwdriver , stepladder , large and small paintbrushes , a roller and pan for the paint . He took his screwdriver and used it to pry the lid off of the can of paint . He picked up the wooden stirrer and stirred the paint thoroughly . He took the paint can and climbed the stepladder until he could reach the ceiling .

The other day , my best friend and I were riding to his house . When we were almost there , I noticed that the front tire on my bicycle felt rather wobbly and was most likely flat . I was in luck however , as my friend had a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires . Once we arrived at my friend 's house , I asked my friend if he let me borrow his bicycle repair kit . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . Finally , I pumped air into the tire until it was filled up and the bicycle was ready to be ridden again .|Where was the tire reconnected?|to the repair kit|0

My friend Thomas was going out of town and asked if I could feed his fish . I said I would of course . Getting into his building was more the challenge .  I had to sign in with the front desk , designate my parking place and give my license plate before the door man would let me in the building .  I cross the lobby and head upstairs .  They look happy and very active . The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food . I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction .  You ca n't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky . I try to get just the right amount . The fish get really active when they notice food and immediately start eating .  Fish are so easy .|What did they enter|the bus|0

They look happy and very active . The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food . I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction .  You ca n't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky . I try to get just the right amount . The fish get really active when they notice food and immediately start eating .  Fish are so easy .|What do they see when they enter the apartment?|Sun shining and a table next to the tank with fish food|1

I got in to my car and drove to the electronics store . When I got there , I went straight to the section that had all the DVD players . I looked at all the different brands on the shelf . I asked myself what kind I should get . I was n't sure what I should get , so I asked a store associate to come over and help me decide which DVD player would be best for me . The store associate said the Sony DVD player that was $ 50 was exactly what I needed so that was what I chose to buy . I took out my wallet and I paid for the DVD player . I walked back to my car and I drove home . I got home and I set up my new DVD player and watched a movie .|Where did they grab the box from?|the garbage|0

When my family was done eating our food for dinner , it was my turn to clean the table of all the food that we had eaten . I first cleared all of the dishes off of the table and took them to the sink . I ran water over the food to make sure that it got off of the plates for my brother who was going to do the dishes . I took a couple of containers and poured any extra food into them so that we could keep them for leftovers . I took it to the table and scrubbed the table down . I picked up any extra scraps that were on the table and kept them in the rag . When I was done , I took the rag to the sink and washed it off .|What was the rag run under?|the sink|1

My whole life I thought the only way to unclog a toilet was by using a plunger and it was disguising . What a terrible thing to have to do , grab this wooden stick with this rubber suction cup looking thing at the end of it that was already dirty with the toilet water from the last time someone used it . Then finally , one day an ex girlfriend tells me that if you pour bleach into a clogged toilet and let it sit for awhile that it will dissolve in there and somehow make the toilet flush able . Since then I do n't even have a plunger and any time I can I share the knowledge with others who do the same thing now and can not believe that it works . I do n't know how plungers even sell anymore .|What was it that worked and how did they feel?|The oil and they feel terrible|0

Every day , since usually my whole family is away at school or work , they get home hungry . On one of these days , recently , I decided that I would be the one to cook dinner for them , figuring that they deserve a break after a whole day 's worth of hard work . First , I had to figure out a meal that I could prepare that everyone would like . After deciding , I prepared the teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove using soy sauce and brown sugar . Once the sauce was done , I added some chopped up chicken and mixed it well to make sure the chicken got an even coating of sauce . Separately from this , I cooked about 3 cups of rice in the rice cooker . Once they all got home from school and work , they were pleased to find that I had made dinner , and they all seemed to think it was delicious .|When did they make some teriyaki chicken and rice?|breakfast|0

Every day , since usually my whole family is away at school or work , they get home hungry . On one of these days , recently , I decided that I would be the one to cook dinner for them , figuring that they deserve a break after a whole day 's worth of hard work . First , I had to figure out a meal that I could prepare that everyone would like . After deciding , I prepared the teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove using soy sauce and brown sugar .

I have a friend that lives far away and I want to send a letter to him . I think about how I can get the letter to him without driving far away . I remember that I can mail the letter . I can pay to have the postal service take my letter and give it to my friend for me , which is much easier . I put the letter inside the envelope and lick the sticky side of the flap . I press down the sticky part of the flap against the envelope to make sure my letter stays safe inside . On the front of the envelope , I write where my friend lives in the center , and where I live in the top left corner . I put a stamp on the top right corner , which shows the postal service that I have paid them . I then drive to the post office and drop the stamped letter into a box where all the letters are picked up and delivered .|What did they write?|A stamp.|0

We are having a tea party ! Megan and Veronica are at my house today . Megan lines up all the chairs while Veronica slides the table over to the kitchen . We gather all of the plastic cups from our grocery store play set and put them on the table in front of the teddy bears . Then we sit at the big table and wait ... `` Wheeeee '' said the kettle as mother scurries over to take it off of the stove . Gives up each a teacup with little flowers on it , and then puts a tea bag in each one . The teddy bears will have to pretend . When she pours the water into our cups , the teabag turns the water brown ! It 's like magic . Then when we are done making the water brown , we take out the teabags and plop a little bit of sugar into our cups . I love tea parties with Veronica and Megan .|When did they put hot water into the kettle?|before putting on stove|1

My husband and I are going on a trip . We purchased our plane tickets online a few weeks ago and today is finally the day . A friend of ours drops us off at the airport near the sign that has our airline service on it . There we show the attendant our tickets in order to let the airline know that we have arrived at the airport for our flight . We hand over our larger suitcases that will be stored in the cargo area of the plane during the flight . My husband 's suitcase is a little heavy , so the attendant weighs it to make sure it 's not over the 50 lb limit that my airline requires . Once our bags were checked , the attendant put a tag on them indicated which flight they will be going on . After we have checked in , we take our carry on bags and tickets and head to the security station . When we arrived at the security station , we stood in a long line and show a TSA agent our drivers license . We placed the tub and our carry on luggage on a table that x-rays your luggage to make sure you are not carrying anything dangerous on the plane . We also had to go through a metal detector . Once we were done we headed to the gate where our plane would be leaving .|What did they remove?|shoes|1

A friend of ours drops us off at the airport near the sign that has our airline service on it . There we show the attendant our tickets in order to let the airline know that we have arrived at the airport for our flight . We hand over our larger suitcases that will be stored in the cargo area of the plane during the flight . My husband 's suitcase is a little heavy , so the attendant weighs it to make sure it 's not over the 50 lb limit that my airline requires . Once our bags were checked , the attendant put a tag on them indicated which flight they will be going on . After we have checked in , we take our carry on bags and tickets and head to the security station . When we arrived at the security station , we stood in a long line and show a TSA agent our drivers license . We placed the tub and our carry on luggage on a table that x-rays your luggage to make sure you are not carrying anything dangerous on the plane . We also had to go through a metal detector . Once we were done we headed to the gate where our plane would be leaving .|Where were the items they put in the tub?|on a table with x-rays|1

After grocery shopping I drove home to put away the items I had purchased , I carried all of the bags into the kitchen and placed them on the counters . After all of the bags were inside , I began to remove items from the bags . The first items which I put away were the items which needed to stay frozen .  I put all of these in the freezer .  I was then able to store all the other food items in the pantry . Because I sometimes have more than one item of each in the pantry , I place the oldest one in front of the new one on the shelf . I had also purchased toilet paper which I carried to the bathroom .  I was happy to have all of the groceries for the week placed where they belonged .|What did they place in the refrigerator?|pantry items or boxed/canned items|0

I try to balance my checkbook at least once a week . The last time I did it , it went like this . I opened Microsoft Excel which contains a spreadsheet that looks like a checkbook register .  Then I tried to placed them all in order by date . Then I tried to smooth them all out the best I could . Then I took each receipt and entered the amount that I spent in the appropriate column and any deposits in its appropriate column as well .  Then I kept doing that until all my receipts were done .  The way I checked that is I logged on to my bank account online . If I saw that it was posted then I un-highlighted the item until I saw that they were all clear . Then I take my balance that I have on Excel and match it with the balance on my bank account on line .  If they matched , I would be done .  However , they did n't match so I had to go back and look at each item again and see what I left out or maybe put in twice .  I found my error and I was done .|When did they try to see what was posted?|after opening excel|0

My daughter 's have birthdays within two months of each other , so every year , instead of presents , we do birthday adventures . This year we planned a mini vacation to a local safari zoo . My husband and I spent hours online searching for something fun and interesting to do . We found a zoo two hours south of us that has hands on safari tours . I called the zoo and scheduled a private tour for our girls . After we booked the tour , my husband and I went online to find local hotels . We went through all the listings and found a suite with a kitchen that we thought would work best for us . We looked up directions on MapQuest to get to the location , and are excited to start our trip this Friday morning .|Who do they think will be happy?|The zoo|0

I brushed my teeth last night . I walked over to my bathroom and grabbed my electronic tooth brush . Then I squeezed a small pea-sized amount of toothpaste out from my tube that I leave out on my bathroom counter ready to go . Then I turn on my faucet in my bathroom sink to get the brush-head and toothpaste wet , because it is easier to spread around in my mouth and it does not feel dry and abrasiveness on my tongue . Then I put the toothbrush in my mouth and slowly and regularly draw it back and forth , up and down , over my teeth . I get the surface of my teeth , behind my teeth , and push down on the caps of my teeth with just enough friction that it cleans them , but not too strong otherwise it will be bad for the brush and hurt my teeth . Then I spit the toothpaste out , take some water from the faucet into my mouth and swish it around in my mouth and then spit it out to get the toothpaste out of my mouth .|When was the brush and mouth dried off?|After they were finished brushing their teeth|1

My wife had just got a new job , but it was in a different city . We sold the house we were living in and moved to the new city staying with friends while we searched for a new house to buy . We wanted one close to my wife 's job so she would n't have to drive too far or spend too much time on the bus . Also , we wanted 3 bedrooms and two bathrooms , an extra room as a hobby/workroom , and a garage . We did n't need a big yard , but wanted some privacy and wanted the neighborhood to not be too noisy . Our bank would loan us money to buy a house a certain price range . Then my wife contacted several real estate agents to find one we liked . After picking one the agent took us around to see the houses . We had our real estate agent make an offer and the owner of the house accepted our price . We were so happy to have bought such a lovely house - our new home .|What had a price that could be afforded?|yard|0

My wife and I invited some friends over to our flat to watch a television show we all like . We needed to make the flat clean so that our friends would be comfortable when they came over . My wife decided to pick up all of the things that were on the floor . I wanted to clean the bathroom , so I went in there with glass cleaner and toilet bowel cleaner to make sure that it was very clean . I poured the toilet bowel cleaner into the porcelain toilet and scrubbed the inside and outside to ensure that it was clean . The kitchen was then cleaned by my wife with a rag and a good cleaner .|What was she making sure was clean?|The floor|1

In the spring I went to the garden center to purchase seeds , fertilizer , and gardening tools . Back at home I dug small holes into the dirt in my garden , placed a few seeds in each hole , and covered the holes with dirt . I then watered the garden , and made sure to water it every day .  Over the next several weeks I removed any weeds that were growing in the garden , and watched as the plants continued to grow . Flowers then appeared on the plants , and bees arrived to pollinate the flowers . Then , vegetables started to grow where the flowers had been .  After a while they began to ripen and continued to grow until they were big enough to pick .|When did small plants grow?|two days|0

One day we decided to go camping . First , we packed all of the food that we would need to have to eat . We packed granola bars , chips , and sandwiches . Then we got into the car and went camping . We drove to the camping site and set up our tent . Then we put our sleeping bags in the tent . We became warm and also roasted some marsh mellows , and made some smores . Then it was getting late so we all went to sleep . The next day we went on a hike in the woods and walked around the whole day . Then we were getting hungry so we ate our food . After that we set up another fire and told scary stories . Then we got back in our car and packed everything up and went home .|What did they decide to start?|a fire|1

My friend was going to have a housewarming party because she just moved to Boston . I was excited to go , even though I did n't really know anyone else besides my friend Sam . It was held on a Friday night , so I put on my cutest skirt and a black shirt and fixed my makeup and hair . The party was in full swing when I arrived , and my friend Sam greeted me at the door . Most of the people were dancing already , but I was apprehensive because I 'm not the best dancer . I went to the kitchen and got myself a beer and sipped on it while watching everything . A guy I did n't know with blonde hair came up to me after a little bit and started to ask me about myself . I spent several hours dancing at the party and ended up having a bit too much to drink so I called an Uber to go home and had to come back for my car the next day .|What was blasting over the speakers?|static|0

The first thing I do before getting ready for bed is I take a shower . Then I get get dressed and brush my teeth . I take the sheets off the bed and smack it hard with a pillow to make sure they are nice and clean . Then I 'll read for about an hour , but sometimes I 'll fall asleep while reading . Then I 'll wake up for a little bit longer and read some more . Then I 'll get off of my bed and go downstairs and check to make sure that all the lights , appliances , electronics , etc. are turned off . Then I 'll check and see if all the doors are locked . Then I 'll crawl into bed and drift off to dreamland .|When will they crawl into bed?|after the shower|1

My first time at the new high end steak house downtown , maybe my expectations were set too high , even though this place was being compared to Ruth 's Chris . The wait staff was very pleasant and well mannered and it was a quiet ambient setting . I decided to order steak -LRB- I normally order fried chicken everywhere I go -RRB- I wanted it medium rare and made that very clear to the waiter , I saw him jot it down when I said it . I waited about 40 minutes which seemed strangely long given there was only 2 other couples in the restaurant one of which already had their food . I pick up my fork with my left hand and my knife with the other . I begin to cut into the steak and realize it 's taking more effort than I expected . I realized why ; it was because my steak was very well done , and dry . I figured I would at least taste it and give it a chance , I do n't like to complain . I called the waiter over and politely explained to him that I knew it was n't his fault , but the steak was not made to order . He offered to bring me another steak , but I sent the steak back and told him I 'd rather just have the fried chicken .|What came out and looked delicious?|steak|1

I wanted to make some extra money so that I could afford a nice vacation later in the year . So , even though I had a full-time job , I decided to get a part time job on the week-ends . I was very open to the type of work that I would be willing to do , but I thought that retail would give me the best opportunity to find week-end work . Then I made sure that my clothing was professional and pleasing . I answered ads in the newspapers , but I also started to drop into different stores to fill out an application and leave a copy of my resume . In all I went to about 35 different places and I got a couple of call backs for interviews . I decided to take the job that was close to where I lived so that I would n't have to spend so much time traveling . I started my new part-time job the very next week-end in a small women 's boutique . I really have enjoyed working there and now I have the extra cash that I needed .|When did they make sure they arrived?|early|1

Then I made sure that my clothing was professional and pleasing . I answered ads in the newspapers , but I also started to drop into different stores to fill out an application and leave a copy of my resume . In all I went to about 35 different places and I got a couple of call backs for interviews . I decided to take the job that was close to where I lived so that I would n't have to spend so much time traveling . I started my new part-time job the very next week-end in a small women 's boutique . I really have enjoyed working there and now I have the extra cash that I needed .|when were the customers worked with|during interview|0

It was a monday night , after dinner that I was preparing to put my son to sleep . The time was around 9PM , which was his bedtime . My son loved the story cat in the hat . I tucked him into bed and turned his little night light on by his bedtime . I pulled a little stool to his bedside and opened his favorite story up . He was really sleepy at the time and I knew he would fall asleep very quickly . I got quieter as the story went on , so he could fall asleep in peace . When he was fully asleep , I shut his little night light off and kissed him on his forehead . I whispered \ \ I love you , goodnight \ \ to him in a soft gentle voice . I shut his door very slowly and gently to not make any noise .|What would be routine?|reading a story at bedtime|1

Every night , I 'll take my son Jimmy to bed . First I take him to the bathroom so that he can brush his teeth and wash his face . Then , I take his hand and lead him to bed , he usually is yawning by the time we get there . I usually read him a story that I let him pick out . The other night he picked out `` Where the Wild Things Are '' which is also his favorite book . After the story , I 'll kiss him goodnight and turn off the light , but usually Jimmy will ask me to turn his nightlight on , but not always as sometimes Jimmy likes to look out his window , but only when the moon is bright and the sky is not cloudy . I will tell him `` good night , '' one last time before I close his door and go to bed myself .|What does he need to be in?|In the moon|0

Today was the start of Spring , so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done . The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat . I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place .  I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting . I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun . Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it .  After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner , I took a look around my flat to assess my work . My apartment was now clean and it felt great !|When did they reduce clutter.|start of spring|1

A few years ago I went to New York City . It 's not easy to drive a car around the city , due to it being so busy and so many people living there . The main options for getting around are walking , taking the subway , bus , or taxi . We usually took the subway around , but decided to take a taxi from my hotel to see the Lion King on Broadway . I went out of the hotel and hailed a taxi by holding my hand up like you might see in the movies . A yellow taxi pulled up to stop , and I got inside . The driver did n't talk much , and drove a little quickly for my liking , but I got there much sooner than the other transportation options would have taken . I paid the driver the fare on the meter , plus a little tip , and went inside to enjoy the show .|What did the driver start?|The taxi meter|1

I went out of the hotel and hailed a taxi by holding my hand up like you might see in the movies . A yellow taxi pulled up to stop , and I got inside . The driver did n't talk much , and drove a little quickly for my liking , but I got there much sooner than the other transportation options would have taken . I paid the driver the fare on the meter , plus a little tip , and went inside to enjoy the show .|What did the driver to after he started the meter?|Drive off|1

I was dressed in my best business outfit , which was clean and pressed and well-fitting . Waiting in the lobby for my turn to be called in to be interviewed , however , I was nervous . I kept tugging at my clothing and readjusting my appearance without realizing it . Finally , I was called into an office which was clean and intimidating . I sat in an uncomfortable chair , across from an important-looking man in a much more comfortable seat . I noticed he did not appear nervous at all . He began the questioning , and my nerves began to fade when he relaxed into the interview , asking questions I expected to hear , and smiling at my unexpected responses . He asked only a few questions related to the job I was interviewing for , and many more about my own personality and tendencies . I felt that I was responding in a way that he liked , and so I continued in that manner , and felt much more confident . At the end of the interview , the man stood up and shook my hand , and told me they would call me after their round of interviews were complete .|What were they that caused fidgeting?|nervous|1

Having bonfire on the beach is one of my favorite things to do while on summer vacation . It is important to only do this activity at the beach because that is the safest place to have a bonfire . My friends and I planned to have a bonfire last night . I was in charge of collecting enough wood for the fire , so I spent the day doing just that . I met my friends at the beach and we started assembling a `` pit '' for the fire . The pit is a circle made with rocks , this keeps the fire contained . We then added the wood to the fire and lit the wood to start the bonfire . Bonfires are a great way to spend time with friends .|What was safely going?|the night time swimming session|0

I needed to find a DVD player for my grandmother 's birthday , but it was late on a Sunday and I did n't know which stores were open . I decided to use google and look up the store 's hours .

My wife and myself were getting tired of our small apartment and wanted something bigger to live in . Plus , we wanted to start having babies and needed the space . We contacted a realtor and he showed us a few houses in areas we liked and that we could afford . There was one house we really loved , so we put in a bid on the house to say what was the highest we would pay . We contacted our bank and they allowed us to get a mortgage loan to buy the house . We paid 20 % of the cost of the house upfront and will now pay the bank back the rest of the 80 % plus interest over the next 20 years . We 're getting close to moving into our new home and are very excited .|what was being planned on being bought?|an apartment|0

My husband and I were finally going on a trip that we had been planning since we got married . Before we could go I had to pack my suitcase . I began by making a list of all of the different things I would need to bring . This was tricky because where we were going experiences many different types of weather within just a few days span . After I had made a list I went and got my suitcase from the closet and made sure that there was nothing left in it from the last time I used it . Next I added my pants and heavier sweaters and sweatshirts . After that I added my shirts and cold weather wear . I ended by packing my socks and belts on the top .|What is the person going on?|a hike|0

Last Friday night my mom took me to shop for new clothes at the mall . The store that we went to had tons of clothes to choose from . We had to ask an employee for directions just to find the kids section ! The nice employee told us that the kids section would be right in front of us when we got to the second floor . My mom and I picked out a couple of great ones that we thought would look really nice . We then started looking at the shirts . It was harder to find nice shirts , but after some time , we were able to find five that we both liked a lot . On our way back to the car , I carried the bag of shorts and my mom carried the bag of shirts .|When did they finally find the kid's section?|after looking at a map|0

A friend came over for dinner recently . While we were waiting for the meal to finish cooking , I asked him if he wanted a drink . He said he sure did and asked for any kind of soda that I had . He said any one of those would be fine so I headed across the room and into the kitchen . I opened the refrigerator and pulled out the two liter bottle of Ginger Ale . Next , I grabbed a large glass from the cupboard and then opened the freezer to remove one of the two ice trays . Then I unscrewed the cap from the soda bottle , tilted the bottle over the glass and filled it up with sparkly Ginger Ale . The drink fizzed and bubbled when it came into contact with the ice cubes . I returned the ice to the freezer and the soda to the refrigerator and then took the drink out to my guest .|What kind of sodas are available?|Sparkling water.|0

Last week I was able to go on a date with my husband . We have been together for a long time , going on nine years , and have a toddler , so it is rare to be able to get away to have a date night . Both our families live pretty far away , so to go out without our child , we have to call a babysitter . We went to a French restaurant , where I had a steak cooked medium rare , and he had a pasta with a creamy sauce and chicken . We split a creme brulee for dessert , paid the bill , left a tip for the waiter , and left . After dinner , we went to see the new Wonder Woman movie , it was action-packed and very exciting to watch .|Where did they go out to?|a french restaurant and a movie|1

We went to a French restaurant , where I had a steak cooked medium rare , and he had a pasta with a creamy sauce and chicken . We split a creme brulee for dessert , paid the bill , left a tip for the waiter , and left . After dinner , we went to see the new Wonder Woman movie , it was action-packed and very exciting to watch .|Who paid the babysitter?|Their family|0

Terri unloads the dishwasher every day for her mother . She knows it is important to keep it free of dishes for the dirty ones to go in . So , after school , Terri unloads any clean dishes her mother cleaned earlier , and puts each cup , plate , and dish away neatly . She takes those out too , and puts them below in the cabinet with the other pots . The last thing she does is puts away the silverware . She has to be careful with that because of the knives . So , she takes each section of silverware carefully , and puts away all the spoons , forks , and knives . When she is done with every dish , and it is empty , she closes the front door of it and locks it . Her mother then can fill it again after dinner , with no worries of clean dishes to put away first .|Where are the pots sometimes in as well?|in the dishwasher|1

Yesterday my sister and I went to the sauna . When we got there the worker said there would be a 15 minute wait . We grabbed a quick workout first . We finally got to go in and after the week I had I do n't think I could have waited much longer . My sister uses the sauna because she says it is spiritual . We set the sauna for 175 degrees and set a timer for 30 minutes . We both chose to go in nude and just sit on a towel . The smell of the cedar when we walked in instantly soothed me . After that we left and we each left the cashier a 10 dollar tip . I cant wait to go back next week .|How long was the sauna?|15 minutes|0

The other day my car was running low on gas so I stopped at the gas station . I had to wait for a free pump before I could park my car to get the gas . Once I got my spot at the pump I turned my car off so as not to give off a spark while pumping my gas . Stepping out of the car I slide my debit card into the card slot and selected debit . Once the machine read my card I pulled it out then entered my pin number . After the company confirmed that I had money in my account they allowed me to select my fuel grade , which for me is mid-grade . I lifted the gas pump , opened my gas tank , slide the nozzle inside , pulled the trigger , and began pumping gas into my car . Once the pump shut off I knew my tank was full so I removed the nozzle returning the pump to its proper place . Once I was buckled I started my car and took off once more .|When did they get out their debit card from their purse?|After paying for gas.|0

Yesterday I went to the gardening store to buy some basil and mint . When I was there I saw a beautiful orchid on sale and decided to buy it as well . When I got home , I felt the soil of the basil and mint and felt it was a bit dry . So I poured some water from the tap into a glass and then slowly poured it into the two pots until they felt moist . Today I read the instructions for caring for the orchid carefully . It said that instead of using normal water , that I should actually use ice cubes . I pulled three ice cubes out of a tray in the freezer and carried them over to the plant in my hand . I then put a reminder in my smartphone 's calendar to tell me to put ice cubes in the pot one week later .|When did they put the ice cubes around the edge of the pot?|yesterday|0

This summer I went on a camping trip to a park near my house in the woods . The park is on a lake so I decided to set up my tent on the shore of the water . I arrived just before dark so I had to hurry to get things set up .  Then I set up the tent and put my sleeping bag inside . As the last light of the day began to fade I hurried and gathered wood for a fire . I set up a fire pit surrounded by rocks .  I had a lighter so I did n't need to resort to any slamming of rocks or rubbing of sticks . Once the fire was nice and big I made a dinner of hotdogs and marshmallows . Then I went to sleep under the stars .|What was the fire started with?|rubbing of sticks|0

Sometimes I enjoy going for a walk because it is a really good , low stress way to exercise . So before I decide I want to go for a walk , I check the internet to see how the weather is going to be that day . Then I go ahead and look around my house for a good pair of walking shoes . I get dressed and put on my shoes . I lace them up , not too tight , but tight enough . Then I go outside and either walk around the neighborhood ( if it 's not too dark ) or I might decide to go to the park . If I do that , I 'll drive my car to the park and park in the parking lot . Then I look to see where the walking trail is located . Then I 'll walk for about an hour or so . When I 'm tired , I 'll get back into my car and drive home .|What will be grabbed if the weather is chilly?|Warm clothing.|1

I ordered a pizza , my usual Thursday night routine , from Racanelli 's pizza , a local pizzeria that cooks real , Italian-style Pizza . My guy Robby answered the call . `` Hey Robby my man . `` Hi , what can I get for you ? '' `` Yes , I 'll take what I usually get '' `` Sure , it 'll be ready in 10 minutes . See you here ! '' `` See you . '' The usual pizza I always ordered was the 12 inch personal pizza , with mushrooms , onion , extra sauce , and spinach . When I had first started ordering pizza , it took up to 20 minutes . I put down my phone and began the drive to Racanelli 's , which would only take 5 minutes to get there . I would be excited to not only pick up my pizza , but also see Robby in person and strike a conversation with him during the 5 minute wait .|What did they want to make?|A pizza|1

Last week I had some trouble with my toilet . Evidently , someone in my family had placed way too much toilet paper in there and now it would not flush properly . So I went to the hardware store and bought a plunger which is like a rubber suction cup on a wooden stick . Then I drove back home and I opened the toilet lid . I flushed it again after the water settled , just to make sure it was really clogged . and I pushed and pushed and pushed until the water went down a little more and then I could tell that the toilet paper was slowly unclogging from the toilet . I pushed down a little more just to be sure , then I flushed the toilet again . It flushed successfully and all of the water went down the toilet like it is supposed to . Then I placed the plunger beside the toilet in case I needed it again .|What did someone close?|The plunger|0

I love to ski but it 's hard to get out on the slopes . One winter morning my friend Ellie and I decided to take off of work to go skiing . We loaded up her truck with our equipment and got on the road .  We went into the changing rooms to put on our bibs , jackets , heavy socks and ski boots . Then we bought our lift tickets , attached them to the zippers on our jackets , and went over to the lift . We put our skis on and got on the lift to take it to one of the easier hills .  We wanted to start slowly before we went on the more difficult hills .  We stood side by side and pushed off . We laughed as we flew down the hill , knowing we were ready to tackle a bigger hill next and confident we 'd be on the black diamonds by the end of the day .|Who positioned themselves on the hill?|The speaker and their friend, Ellie.|1

Generally I have the same morning routine every day . My routine differs on days that I do n't have to work but I work most days and will talk about that . I wake up to my alarm clock and then go to the bathroom and take a shower . I use an electric toothbrush that cleans my teeth really well . I take the toothpaste out of the bathroom cabinet and grab my toothbrush from the toothbrush holder on the sink . I put toothpaste on the toothbrush and then put the toothbrush in my mouth . Once the toothbrush is in my mouth I turn it on and the head of the toothbrush begins to spin . What I really like about my toothbrush is that it vibrates every 30 seconds to let you know how long you have been brushing . I then spit out the toothpaste in the sink and rinse off the toothbrush . I finish off by lightly rinsing my mouth out with water .|What does the person say is done before the toothbrush is used?|Spitting out the toothpaste.|0

Typically my board game evenings are organized a week in advance . I determine the style of board games I want to play for the night , either competitive or cooperative . Sometimes I would want to play a kickstarter game I just received in the mail .  Depending on the type of game night I want , I send out a facebook invitation to a few of my friends interested in the particular game style .  In this particular case , we decided to go for a competitive theme , which included games like ticket to ride . In terms of food , I kept the invite simple , order takeout from the local chinese restaurant with the event starting at 6PM on a Friday night . I typically use the casual midnight as the end date but it is not set in stone .|Who typically responds to the invite?|Facebook friends|1

Last week , my mom told me about a fundraiser she is running . It involves making meals for the elderly . She wants me to gather my friends together , and bake different items . Then it dawned on me ; what if I was elderly and needed a helping hand here and there . That thought was nagging at me . I decided to put my anger aside , and do a good deed . We made Chilli , lasagna , a cake , chicken amongst other things . When we finally served the elders the food we could tell how much it meant to them . I 'll look back on that week for the rest of my life and know that me putting my pride to the side for just a little bit , impacted people in a tremendous way .|What kind of meal did they want to serve?|chilli, lasagna, cake, & chicken amongst other things|1

When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .|What type of hole was there?|A hole in the fabric.|0

I like to iron cloths , because I like to look nice and neat . I took out the ironing board and set it up near a plug in . I got the outfit that I wanted to wear , a shit and a pair of pants . While pre heating , I read the label on the shirt to see what temperature to iron it on . It is a cotton shirt with printed logo of my favorite band . To avoid melting the design , I placed the iron on a low temp and placed a towel over the shirt so the iron would not touch the design . I ironed the shirt sleeves first , starting with the shoulder and working my way back and forth perpendicular to the fibers towards the arm opening . I repeated the process for the body of the shirt , then hung it on a hanger while I ironed the pants . The pants would need to be ironed at a higher temperature , So I turned the iron up , placed the jeans on the ironing board with the jeans laying there like someone where wearing them .|Where did they run the iron?|on the ironing board|1

Today I had a doctors appointment . I woke up early , brushed my teeth and then got dressed . I walked downstairs and ate my breakfast quickly . I got into my car and was on my way . It only took 10 minutes to get to my destination . When I walked into the Dr 's office , I signed in and took a seat near the window . The nurse finally called me back . I started with the nurse taking my weight and height . She then took a few more things such as blood pressure and my temperature . Once we were done with that , she led me to my room to see the Dr. Once he arrived , he asked me a few questions about my overall health . He said that everything seemed just fine . I left shortly after . Got into my car and drove back home . My visit was good .|How long does it take to go to the doctor?|Ten minutes.|1

The last time that I folded clothes , I did so in my room . This was an easy and relaxing process , but since I had a large load of clothes to fold , it was somewhat time consuming . I went through every piece of clothing and folded it in a similar and orderly fashion . Upon finishing this activity , I put some clothes in the drawer and I hung other articles of clothing up . I felt that my room seemed much more cleaner and I felt accomplished . Everything was in the place that it belonged and everything was dry and clean . This process was easy , but it did take a large amount of time due to the large amount of clothes that I had to fold . I should have taken it little by little instead of doing it all at once .|Wheat happened with the folded clothes?|They hung them up|0

This morning I decided to make my bed after walking up . I first removed all of the sheets , blankets , and pillows from the mattress -LRB- except for the fitted sheet -RRB- . I picked up the flat sheet first and spread it on top of the mattress . I pulled it all the way up to the top of the mattress , and then folded it down about a foot and a half . Once the sheet was even on both sides and smooth , I spread out my blanket on top of it . I again made sure that it was even on both sides . I also placed the two large pillows on the top of the mattress at the head of the bed . I topped the quilt with matching decorative pillows placed on top of the large pillows already at the head of the bed .|What did they tuck underneath the mattress?|Large pillows|0

He makes it smooth and buffs out any rough edges with a machine that runs across the floor . Then he takes some polish and seals the floor , to protect the new floor . Sometimes he has to do this seven or eight times , and it makes the floor protected and shine . When he is finished , he checks for any cracks or edges that need to be sanded down and repaired .|He is finished if there are no what?|cracks or edges that need to be sanded down and repaired|1

It is the first Weekend of December . We still do n't have a Christmas tree in our house , and we need to start putting up decorations . In order to decorate , we need to go buy a tree . My wife and I got out of the car and walked over the the large rows of Christmas Trees . We know that we needed something that was n't going to be too tall and would n't fit in our living room . Also , we needed one that was going to be wide and big around . It was just a little taller than I was . It had a wide base with branches all around it , and it looked very fresh and healthy . We walked over to the farmer who was at the end of the row and paid him for the tree . They chopped it down for us and wrapped it in a protective wrapping to withstand the wind on our drive back . We tied down the tree to the roof with cables and make sure it was tight and secure . After so , we drove back home with our newly bought Christmas tree .|What did they walk up and down?|The living room|0

I looked at my alarm clock one night and the screen was blank , so I knew the batteries were probably dead . I picked up the alarm clock and turned it over , looking at the back and bottom for a place where the batteries go . On the bottom of the clock I saw what looked like a little rectangular door with a latch on one side . The little rectangular door came off the clock and underneath I saw two batteries . They said AA on them , so I knew they were double A. I went into the kitchen and found some double A batteries in a drawer . I took them back to the clock , and pulled the old batteries out of the clock . I checked inside the clock where the batteries had been and saw a picture of a battery in each spot where the batteries go . I lined up the bumpy end and flat end of each battery with the picture inside the clock when I put the new batteries in . Then I put the little door back on the clock the same way i took it off , by pushing in on the latch and this time pressing it down into place .|What did they press the latch with?|battery|0

Taking medicine is something I have to remind to do every day . Today I took medicine in order to keep my blood pressure down . The way I take medicine is to first get a glass of water , and then to take a pill . It could be bad for the esophagus if you do n't do it in this order . I 'm pretty used to it since I do it everyday , and there 's not much to it . Some people take medicine with a liquid medicine or by getting a shot . My best way to get my blood pressure down is by following the doctor 's instructions and taking this medication that he prescribed me .

The way I take medicine is to first get a glass of water , and then to take a pill . It could be bad for the esophagus if you do n't do it in this order . I 'm pretty used to it since I do it everyday , and there 's not much to it . Some people take medicine with a liquid medicine or by getting a shot . My best way to get my blood pressure down is by following the doctor 's instructions and taking this medication that he prescribed me . I 'm glad I take this medication .|What do they take every day?|A blood pressure pill.|1
We were going to Disney World ! But first we had to get ready . We looked up tickets to Disney World and for the airplane ride on the internet and bought them . Then we had to pack . I had lots of cool Disney shirts . I also packed the rest of my clothes , my toothbrush and toothpaste and stuff for cleaning my hair . Once everything was all packed , I double-checked my travel checklist . I had n't forgotten a thing ! After standing in line and going through the metal detectors , we got to our terminal and waited for our plane to arrive to take us to Disney World . We flew on the airplane to Florida , and took a taxi to our hotel . We checked in , carried our bags up to our room , and then looked at the different brochures for Disney World . We made a list of things we would get started on the next day while we ate dinner we got from room service , then we went to sleep . In the morning , we got ready to go out by getting dressed , eating breakfast , and brushing our teeth . We grabbed our itinerary and started off . We crossed off a bunch of things on our to-do list every day . We ate breakfast and dinner at the hotel , but we always ate lunch out in the different parks . We bought souvenirs , too . We had a total blast !|When were the fourteen shirts packed?|before they left home|1

Have you ever had chocolate made from milk and cocoa instead of hot chocolate from a packet and hot water ? It is so delicious . First you will need hot milk . Pour your milk into a pan and turn the burner on . The burner will cause the milk to heat up and it will start to bubble . Once you have rolling bubbles of milk you know your milk is boiling . Make sure that the sugar and cocoa dissolve well . Turn off your burner and let stand to cool before pouring into your cup or drinking it . This is a much tastier way of drinking hot chocolate .|Where should the cocoa and sugar be mixed into?|the boiling milk.|1

Museums are awesome places filled with things of the past and I was curious what I could learn . I decided to go to a museum . First I have to find out if admission is free or if there a cost for entry . It was free of cost on certain days , so I decided on one of those days . Then I planned on my transportation method and decided to take a bike ride there . I made sure to pack proper previsions such as drinks and snacks . Once I took my bike ride there and entered , I had a look around at all the exhibits . I also made sure to learn as much as possible and took pictures of things that stood out and I liked . Once I got done with most exhibits I headed home .|When did they found out if admission was free or not?|before they planned their transportation method|1

I wanted to buy a fruit tree for my garden . Most fruit trees are very pretty when they have flowers on , and then in summer or fall they have fruit on too ! I was very excited . The garden shop had lots of different kinds of tree , apples , pears , plums and peaches . I decided I wanted a peach tree . All the trees for sale were only about as tall as I am , and very thin , to make it easier for one person to plant them . They were all in very big plastic pots , but would need to be planted in the ground to grow best . I put the tree in my cart and went to check out . The woman at the check out explained that when I got home I was going to have to dig a very big hole to put my tree in , and then give it lots of water every day for at least a week . I promised to do that . I wanted the tree to do well .|When did they take the tree home to plant?|after buying it|1

All the trees for sale were only about as tall as I am , and very thin , to make it easier for one person to plant them . They were all in very big plastic pots , but would need to be planted in the ground to grow best . I put the tree in my cart and went to check out . The woman at the check out explained that when I got home I was going to have to dig a very big hole to put my tree in , and then give it lots of water every day for at least a week . I promised to do that . I wanted the tree to do well .|Where did they carefully load the tree?|into the trunk|1

When I was a kid I loved going down to the playground . I would beg my mom to take me down to the park where there was a little playground . We got into a routine where she would take me after school . I 'd rush home , quickly finish my homework , pour a drink and make a sandwich and after an hour I would be done . So then I 'd go grab my mom usually in the lounge or in her study and we would head off to the playground . We 'd throw a tennis ball to each other and sometimes we would take my dog with and let her run around crazily . I loved the pipe and the little obstacles , it made for a great time and I have so many fun memories about being at the playground and I will always remember it fondly .|Who would they swing with?|With their mom|1

Last night I told my husband that I planned on scheduling a board game night once a week with our little family . He thought it was a great idea . We have lots of games like Monopoly , Sorry , Scrabble . In the morning I mentioned it to our kids who were very excited about it . We picked out a day of the week that everyone was happy with . When game night came , I was able to surprise my family with a few new games I picked up at the store . We ended up playing Candy land and had a blast ! There is nothing better than spending quality time with my family . The kids are growing up quickly and we need to cherish them while they are little and spend as much time with them as we can .|Who were they going to surprise?|their husband|0

Last week , my family and I moved from our hometown in New Jersey , to New York City because my daughter is starting college in the fall . We have a 3 bedroom house and quite a bit of furniture . So we did n't have to do all of the heavy lifting , we only packed in the car what we could safely carry . Since we could n't lift certain heavy items , we found a moving company in the phone book and hired them . Bigger furniture like the couch and TV stand were safely packed in a big truck , by a local moving company . The moving company drove with us to New York City and helped us unload all of our furniture , and then we showed them where we wanted it in the house .|What were placed in their vehicles?|heavy furniture|0

I was so excited ; my mom was taking me shopping to buy books ! It was cold and rainy out , so I had to put on my shoes and jacket first and grab my Katniss umbrella . Then I went out with my mom to the car . Once we got inside , I looked at the store . All the shelves were arranged in sections . There were books for little kids , books for people like me , books for grown-ups , and every kind of book in between . On the way there , I grabbed a basket so that I would n't have to carry all my books around and make my arms tired . The books were lined up in ABC order on the shelves , using the author 's last name to show where they were supposed to go . I found a book about dragons , another book about pirates , and a book about kangaroos . I grabbed all of them and put them in my basket . When I had enough , I went and found my mom in the grown-up section . She had a book about dragons and pirates , too . Holding my hand , we walked up to the checkout counter . I put my basket on the counter and the woman behind the cash register scanned them with a red laser that told her how much each book cost . When she told my mom , my mom pulled a plastic credit card out of her purse . Then the woman put our books in a shopping bag . I took the bag and my mom and I left the store to go home .|When did the mom pay for the books?|after being told the total cost|1

There were books for little kids , books for people like me , books for grown-ups , and every kind of book in between . On the way there , I grabbed a basket so that I would n't have to carry all my books around and make my arms tired . The books were lined up in ABC order on the shelves , using the author 's last name to show where they were supposed to go . I found a book about dragons , another book about pirates , and a book about kangaroos . I grabbed all of them and put them in my basket . When I had enough , I went and found my mom in the grown-up section . She had a book about dragons and pirates , too . Holding my hand , we walked up to the checkout counter . I put my basket on the counter and the woman behind the cash register scanned them with a red laser that told her how much each book cost . When she told my mom , my mom pulled a plastic credit card out of her purse . Then the woman put our books in a shopping bag . I took the bag and my mom and I left the store to go home .|What type of books?|A book about dragons, a book about pirates, and a book about kangaroos.|1

I had to give a big presentation at my work about how well we were doing . I had booked a conference room to have the meeting in . When I got there , none of the presentation equipment was set up !  There was a big screen at one end of the room and a projector which put the picture on the screen . I turned on the projector and made sure it was pointing at the screen correctly . I had to turn off the lights in the room to make the projection bright enough to see .  I connected my laptop to the projector with a cable and set the slide show ready to go . I have a little remote control that moves between the slides , so I checked that I could go forwards and backwards on the slides . Then I sat down and waited for everyone else to arrive .|What was a slide show?|A presentation for work|1

When I was in high school , I always needed the help of an alarm clock to wake me up in the morning . This would help me get all of my things ready for the day and get to school on time . One morning , though , the alarm clock did n't go off , and I ended up waking up and going to school much later than usual . After school that day , I realized that the battery on the alarm clock was probably dead , so I walked to a convenience store close to my school to pick up some batteries . I had my mom pick me up from the store , and after getting home , I changed the batteries on the alarm clock . That night , I set my usual alarm , and sure enough , it went off right on time the next morning . Unlike the day before , I was able to get all of my things ready and be at school right on time .|What did they know would work the next morning?|not setting the alarm|0

When I was in high school , I always needed the help of an alarm clock to wake me up in the morning . This would help me get all of my things ready for the day and get to school on time . One morning , though , the alarm clock did n't go off , and I ended up waking up and going to school much later than usual . After school that day , I realized that the battery on the alarm clock was probably dead , so I walked to a convenience store close to my school to pick up some batteries . I had my mom pick me up from the store , and after getting home , I changed the batteries on the alarm clock . That night , I set my usual alarm , and sure enough , it went off right on time the next morning . Unlike the day before , I was able to get all of my things ready and be at school right on time .|What would work the next morning?|The television|0
The weather was nice today , warm and sunny with no sign of rain , so my best friend and I decided to have a picnic . First , we thought about a good location , and decided to go to a state park not very far away . The park has lots of picnic tables , plus trails for hiking and other activities we could do after eating . We put some ice in the bottom of the cooler . After that , we put in some bottled water , then potato salad and fruit , stored in their own sturdy plastic containers . The sandwiches went on top , where they would n't get squished by the heavier items . We packed the cooler in the trunk of my car , along with some sunscreen and bug spray , and drove to the state park . While we ate our meal , we watched the wildlife nearby . Squirrels played in the tree , birds flew overhead , and a deer cautiously crept out of the woods to graze at the edge of the clearing . When we finished eating , we picked up all of the trash and put it into a bag . We carried the cooler and the trash back to the car and put it away before going hiking .|What would become lighter once the ice was out?|the cooler|1

Cooking fish is a fun and cool activity that many people can do because there are so many steps . First the step is to find a good sized fish . Now I know what your thinking , and you can not just grab any ole fish out of a tank or something you found in a stream . My favorite fish to cook is probably drum , so once you have a good nice drum you first have to cut it . Get all the meat off of it and then there are a number of ways to cook it . I like to fry my fish , so I season it with a number of thinks and then make sure to cover it in flour and bread crumbs . I then heat the oil I will be using to fry it to a very hot temperature and then dunk the fish in the oil until it is nice and brown .|Who needs a fish?|the fish.|0

Fish is my all time favorite dish from anywhere . I prefer fresh fish . We have big international market , and I bought some pomfret fish , which was $ 4 per pound . I bought 3 lbs . I decided to make fry fish . I told the butcher to make thin slices . I washed them nicely , dried them on paper . Then , I seasoned flour with all time spice . Now , one by one I coated fish in seasoned flour and set aside . I put them in refrigerator for half an hour . When It became hot enough , I slowly put pieces of fish one by one , next to each other . Did not overcrowd them . I let it cook each side for at least 3 to 4 minutes , and then turned them over , and cooked another 3 minutes on medium temperature . It was very crispy and delicious .|When did they put the pan on the stove?|Before putting the fish in the refrigerator|1

When I was in high school , I played on the football team , the Lions . Our team was well loved by the town we lived in , and every Friday night the football game was a big event . I was a defensive tackle .  Even though I was n't very good , I loved being a part of the team .  The Lions were always very good in the regular season , but would lose a few rounds into the playoffs . My senior year of high school was going to be different . We had a true star quarterback named Johnny .  Even though I was n't very good , he never made me feel bad about it , even as he would make amazing 60 yard passes every game . Sure enough , with Johnny at the lead , we finally won a state championship my senior year . It was a good year to be playing football .|When were they frustrated by the outcome of the last few seasons?|During the regular season.|0

We made our selection at the steakhouse , slowly sipping our wine to kill the time when the waitress arrived with salads and soon after the entrees . I picked up my knife and began to cut only to realize that the steak was medium . I was so disappointed . I had a moment 's hesitation wondering if I should send it back . I remembered my days working in a restaurant and all things that happen to food that was sent back but in the end , I decided to be very polite and the waitress if she would indeed take my steak back to kitchen knowing they would have to start over . It would totally kill the timing of our dinner but I had waited so long to come try these steaks that I decided it was worth the risk .|What did they make?|The cook made steak|1

When my wife and I were dating , I asked her to go dancing with me . There was a club in the city that had line dancing on Saturdays . I picked her up one of those Saturdays and took her to the club . After we got in , the music started to get really loud and we got really excited . We jumped out into the dance floor and started to dance with each other . We would stomp our feet and clap our hands . We would twirl around and jump around . We went to the side of the floor and got a drink that was over there . She said she had a lot of fun but was tired , so I went and dropped her off at her house .|When did they dance at the club?|Saturdays|1

My sister has an appointment this morning , so I happily agreed to watch my one year old niece and 3 year old nephew so she could go . Before they arrived , I made sure that my outlets still had child covers on them so there would be no chance of either child getting hurt on the outlet . I also put baby gates across the stairs leading downstairs . I would never want them to tumble down . When my sister arrived , she gave me information on when they normally eat a snack and lunch and what time they usually take a nap . She also gave me a diaper bag with extra diapers , wipes , a change of clothes and a favorite toy . I was certainly going to do that . Our first task was building large colorful towers with duplo blocks that my niece loved to knock over and my nephew loved to rebuild . We listened to " The Wiggles " and danced and sang and then it was time for a potty break / diaper change and a snack . With both kids rubbing their eyes , it was very apparent that it was now nap time , right on schedule . After a nap and a lunch of small pieces of chicken and vegetables with mac and cheese , I heard a knock on the door and my sisters voice .|How quickly had the time passed?|very quicky|1

On Monday I usually go grocery shopping , so I decided to make my shopping list in the morning . First , I decided what meals I would make during the week and thought about all of the ingredients I would need to prepare the meals . I looked in my fridge and pantry to see what ingredient I was missing . I also looked at commonly used items , such as milk , bread , and eggs to make sure that I had them . I wrote down anything that was almost gone or completely gone . I then wrote down any household items that I needed , like paper towels and laundry soap . I am planning to have friend over this weekend for a cookout , and needed paper plates . I included these on my list . After finishing my list , I read through it and double checked it before taking it with me to the grocery store .|When did they think ahead about any supplies they might need for the upcoming week?|In the afternoon|0

On Monday I usually go grocery shopping , so I decided to make my shopping list in the morning . First , I decided what meals I would make during the week and thought about all of the ingredients I would need to prepare the meals . I looked in my fridge and pantry to see what ingredient I was missing . I also looked at commonly used items , such as milk , bread , and eggs to make sure that I had them .

During the Summer , I like to go and visit my grandma who lives down south in Florida . She lives in Florida during the summer , while I live up north in Minnesota , so I have to purchase a plane ticket to fly down to see her . When I get there , she 's waiting for me at the airport to pick me up and take me to her house . I sit and talk with her for a long time when we get there , catching up on everything she and grandpa have been doing in Florida . When it gets late , I go out to find a hotel to stay at , but sometimes I sleep over at grandma 's house . When I 'm with grandma , we arrange time to go out and eat at restaurants , play games together , and just spend a lot of time hanging out . The whole ride home , I think about the next time I 'll visit her !|Where will they fly to when their visit is over?|home to Minnesota|1

One evening , I noticed my alarm clock had stopped working , because I had just checked the clock in the living room , and my alarm clock showed a different time . I knew I had to change the batteries . This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work .  I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required : two AA-sized batteries . These are quite common , and I got them from the kitchen drawer . I removed the old batteries by lifting them up , then I placed the new batteries in the same position , making sure the plus-side of the batteries -LRB- the little tip -RRB- were in the right direction , as it is usually engraved on the plastic .  I adjusted the time with the help of my watch , and went to bed , knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning .|When did they grab the clock?|The same morning|0

Sometimes I love to watch movies with my husband . When we do n't have the kids home to disturb us we like to buy a move on demand right from our own living room . The last time we decided to play a movie , my husband went to the `` on demand '' feature on our TV and scrolled through all the `` new release '' movies that were available . We both saw a few movies that we wanted to watch , but we did n't want to watch all of the same movies , so we needed to decide on one . We finally decided to watch a movie we both agreed on . We both watched the movie in quiet without any one disturbing us . It was really nice . I look forward to having those movie days with my husband since they are few and far between these days .|When did the movie start playing?|After deciding what movie to watch.|1

My mother and I decided on Saturday afternoon to replace the floor in our house . It was looking a little old and worn . We drove to Home Depot and bought all of the supplies we would need . Once back home , we had the fun work of ripping up the old floor . That was fun , but very messy . Next we had to make sure it was very clean . Once , the area was completely clean , we put the glue all over the bare cement . Then we carefully laid down the floor pieces , making sure that the pattern was aligned correctly . The final step was to wait for the entire thing to dry . When we got back home , we admired our new floor with pride . It felt really nice to replace the floor ourselves and it made the house look great .|what was  ddrying while they went to lunch|steps|0

When I was a young child we played football every Thanksgiving with the family . It was so much fun . First we would arrive at my grandparents ' house . Then , while the food was being cooked we would go outside in the back yard and split up into teams . It was a lot of fun . We played flag football , which means that you grab the flag off someone instead of tackling them . We played this way because there were a lot of younger kids like me playing that did not need to get hurt playing traditional football . After the game was over we would all go inside and eat Thanksgiving dinner . This is a very special memory to me and all of my other family members .|Who was the first relative mentioned?|Their grandparents.|1

Yesterday I chopped up vegetables for a salad . I removed all of the ingredients that I needed for my salad from the fridge . This included lettuce , tomato , cucumber , onion , broccoli , and carrot . I placed each vegetable on the cutting board and began to cut them with a large knife , making sure to remove peels and stems that were inedible . I threw these parts away in the garbage . I made sure to cut the vegetables into small , bite-sized pieces and slices , especially the larger vegetables like broccoli and lettuce . As I finished cutting each vegetable , I put it into a large bowl . Once all of the vegetables were chopped up , I put my cutting board and knife into the sink to be washed later .|What did they remove from the cabinet?|Cutting board|1

I was babysitting for a friend who had a six month old baby girl . My friend had just left to go run some errands when I noticed that it smelled like Savannah 's diaper needed to be changed . I pulled out her changing mat , gloves , and some wipes . I unfolded the changing mat on the ground , put on some gloves , and gently placed the baby on the changing mat . I rolled the dirty diaper into itself and placed it in the diaper disposal can right next to me . I used some wipes to clean the baby off , then took a new diaper out of her diaper container . I opened up the new diaper and lifted up the baby 's legs to put the diaper underneath her . I made sure the diaper was secure so there would n't be any leaking , and then I rebuttoned the baby 's onesie .|Whose onesie did they unbutton?|The friend|0

Yesterday night we went out to dinner at an Indian restaurant . It was a casual dining restaurant with decent tables and chairs . We arrived at the restaurant at 8 PM . We looked at the menu briefly and ordered appetizers first . We ordered Vegetable Pakora and Paneer Pakora . This gave us some time to decide on the main course . We pondered whether we should order the Vegetable Biryani or not for a few minutes . We decided to skip it after looking at other tables and seeing portions were big . The food was delicious and we decided to skip dessert since it was so filling . We will come back another time to try out other dishes and dessert too . We enjoyed the night out .|What did they order along with the main course and Butter Naan?|rice|0

It was time for a new flooring . Our carpeting had been worn and old , so we decided to go to laminate floors . We measured the size of the room to get the area and we ordered the flooring at the lumber yard . The cartons of flooring were heavy . We also needed to purchase rolls of underlay . We tore the carpet up and threw it out . Then we lay down the underlay mats . After just laying down the underlay , we took a short break . Then it was time to put down the laminate . It was hard to lock the pieces together , but it came out nicely . We were proud of the hard work we did .|What was it that made them sweat a lot?|knocking down a wall|0

I have an orange tree in my front yard . This morning , I decided I wanted to make some fresh orange juice with the fruit that my tree produced . I asked my little boy if he wanted to come , and of course , he did . We headed outside and picked some oranges off the tree . We found that twisting them off the branch was easiest . We also used the grabber to pick up the fruit that had fallen off the tree onto to ground . We filled out bucket and headed inside . Next , we got out our juicer . Then , we cut the oranges in half and pressed the on top the juicer , catching the juice in a container . We poured our juice over ice and had the most delicious glass of fresh orange juice ever !|What was gathered to collect juice?|the bucket|0

I had decided that I wanted to visit my friend Paul whom lives quite a distance away . With this and my fear of air travel in mind I decided to take a train . After researching and finding one online I was well on my way to going to see my friend Paul . I drive to the station and decide that I am going to purchase a round trip ticket as this would be cheaper than just buying both tickets separately . Whenever my train arrives I have to get in line as they process our tickets . After all this is done I decide to take a seat by the window . I sit and fall asleep a bit as I ride on the train for hours . After a couple hours we finally reach the destination and I get off the train , excited to see my friend .|When did they wait for their train?|before buying the ticket|0

Yesterday , I really wanted some fresh orange juice . I did n't have any oranges , so I drove to the grocery store and bought a dozen oranges . After paying for the oranges , I then drove back home .  I brought the oranges into the kitchen and put them on the counter while I looked for my orange juicer in the cabinet .  I got out my bread board and found my large chef knife in the knife rack . I took the oranges to the sink and washed all the oranges . I then began to cut all of the oranges in half .  It is a hand juice and takes a little muscle to get all the juice out . I transfer the juice to a pitcher . After I had juiced all 12 oranges , I had enough for a full pitcher of orange juice .  It was delicious .|Where was the orange juice extracted?|In the orange juicer.|1

I got out my bread board and found my large chef knife in the knife rack . I took the oranges to the sink and washed all the oranges . I then began to cut all of the oranges in half .  It is a hand juice and takes a little muscle to get all the juice out . I transfer the juice to a pitcher . After I had juiced all 12 oranges , I had enough for a full pitcher of orange juice .  It was delicious .|Where did they place the juicer?|In the cabinet.|0

I am taking viola lessons from a lady at my church . She said that once I get good enough , we will play a duet at church . I practice hard every day .  I practice extra hard . We practice together during our lessons until we are ready to play our song in church . We sit patiently through the service until it is time for us to play .  We get up and go to stand near the piano .  I make a mistake , but I find my place again and finish the song . When we are finished , we go back and take our seats . I am relieved that it is finished and hope that the congregation was blessed to hear my song .|What do they do before starting to play?|eat lunch|0

This morning I wanted to make myself a healthy breakfast and decided that since I had just gone grocery shopping the day before , I should make use of all the healthy and delicious vegetables that I had bought . I set out all the ingredients that I needed , which I pulled from out fridge . I put them on the kitchen counter along with the kitchen tools and cutlery I would be using to prepare it . I wanted tomatoes and lettuce as the main ingredients so I set to work chopping them up and adding them to a relatively large salad bowl . I then wanted some spice so I added a large serving of pepper dressing onto the vegetables I had put in the bowl , and then I mixed it all together and served myself my scrumptious home made salad .|What ended up being included in the salad?|kitchen tools|0

Last night I cooked pork chops for dinner . I put the oven on to 375 F . While the oven was heating up I got the pork chops ready . I put the chops in an oven safe dish and then I washed my hands again . It 's important to wash your hands after touching raw meat , so you do n't get sick . I sprinkled some salt , pepper and herbs over the top of the chops and I added a little bit of broth , too , so the meat would n't dry out . When the oven was hot enough I put the dish in the oven and set the timer for 20 minutes . While the meat was cooking , I cooked some vegetables too . After 20 minutes , I put on oven gloves to protect my hands , and took the dish out of the oven . When I knew they were hot enough I served dinner to my family .|Where did they poke the meat thermometer?|on the outside of the meat|0

After work yesterday , I remembered that I needed to get gas before I could drive home . I pulled up to the station near the ramp where I get on the highway , and stopped next to the only available pump . I like this station because it has the cheapest gas in town , and yesterday it was $ 2.75 / gallon . I did n't have any cash on me , which is good because I would have wanted to use my credit card anyway . Then I chose regular unleaded gas , and opened my gas tank . I started pumping , and locked the handle in place so I did n't have to hold it while the tank filled . It automatically filled up , and then I replaced the pump in the machine . I like to get a receipt because it helps me keep track of how often I need gas , so I pressed YES when the machine asked me if I wanted one .|When did they get back in the car?|After the pump was replaced in the machine.|1

After a long day at work , the thing I want and love the most is a hot bath . I like to run the water very hot ! I like bubbles added , the kind that smell like mangoes . Once the tub is full , I finally allow myself to get in . Ah , perfect ! I lay back and let the hours of work just slip away . Sometimes I 'll bring a book in with me and sink into a good story as the hot water dulls away any aches and pains . When I have finally had enough , I 'll slowly drain the tub , and then get up and dry off with a huge fluffy towel . After taking a bath I always feel refreshed and relaxed !|How are the bubbles described?|They smell like mangoes|1

Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene . This is something that I had to do just recently . I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained , and that the mirrors were filthy . I first worked on the counter tops . I used a special marble cleaner to clean them , and it really made them shine . After the counters , I did the mirrors . I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done , and by the time I finished , the mirrors were spotless . Lastly , I took care of the toilet . I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters , and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl . Just for good measure , I mopped the floor of the bathroom , washed out the bathtub with shower cleaner , and sprayed the room with air freshener to make it smell nice .|The necessary cleaners were set aside to use where?|The kitchen.|0

The last time that I made a flight reservation , I planned everything well in advance . I spoke with my dad and sister and my dad told me that in order to not get ripped off , you have to constantly check the prices of airfare and keep checking often . He said that prices tend to be cheaper on certain days of the week and you should clear your search history to avoid the airlines keeping the prices high . This took a lot of work and required me looking around at different airlines for the perfect fight . While this process was somewhat long and difficult , I felt great that I was able to get a good deal and save a lot of money . Unfortunately , I also had to pick seats and pay more and also pay more for bags .|When did they review the prices?|while looking for a flight|1

Mary took the check book out of her purse and put it on the kitchen table . Fred took the stack of mail from by the door and put it by the check book . Both of them grabbed a pen from the drawer by the kitchen phone , and sat down at the table to begin discussing how they were going to pay all the incoming bills for the months to come . Fred had been laid off for two weeks at the beginning of the month , so things had been a little tighter than usual . Fred wrote checks for home and entertainment ; the mortgage , all the credit cards , and any shopping bills for clothing and groceries . They both preferred to work in silence , and enjoyed the moment when they had addressed and stamped all the envelopes , then went outside to put them in the mailbox together . Fred kissed her when they got to the front door .|Who wrote checks for the household bills?|Fred|1

Once when I was a child , I had to go to the dentist . I was about seven , and my front two teeth were starting to grow up into my gums and it was becoming painful . My mom took me inside , and when they called my name , we went back to a room where a dental assistant greeted us and cleaned my teeth before doing the actual extraction of my front two teeth . I was scared . When she attempted to put the injection around my gums , as a knee-jerk reaction , I bit her finger . She was really unpleasant about it . So instead of attempting to numb the area again , she just pulled out my teeth with a pair of pliers while I screamed . She had me then bite on some thick gauze and lay back in the chair . I was given my teeth in a small , pink treasure chest and sent on my way . I do n't like going to the dentist anymore .|What did the person see?|dentist|1

I was scared . When she attempted to put the injection around my gums , as a knee-jerk reaction , I bit her finger . She was really unpleasant about it . So instead of attempting to numb the area again , she just pulled out my teeth with a pair of pliers while I screamed . She had me then bite on some thick gauze and lay back in the chair . I was given my teeth in a small , pink treasure chest and sent on my way . I do n't like going to the dentist anymore .|What did she prepare?|teeth|0

Once a month my girlfriend and I go to Costco for our big supplies . We take a lot of big bags with us and take the bus about 30 minutes to the Costco by us . Once there we get a cart and show our membership badge on the way in . We go up and down all the aisles getting everything on our list . We are usually very good about only getting what is on the list but sometimes we treat ourselves or find something on sale . Once we are done , we head to the registers and wait in line to make our purchases . When we get to the register we put our items on the conveyer belt so the clerk can scan them . At the end I make sure to pay for everything with my credit card . I make sure to keep my receipt out so the security guard can check it and we order a car service and go home .|What do they pack in the bags?|big supplies|1

He starts looking up golf tournaments that our in our area . He downloads movies about golf for us to watch . The funny part about all of this is that he has never played an actual round of golf .|What did he look up?|golf community|0

I wrote a letter to a friend yesterday . I began by picking out a piece of paper and a pen . I chose my favorite blue pen . Then I started a new paragraph and wrote about some things that were happening in my life . I told her about what I 'd been doing , and how I 'd been feeling . When I 'd written down everything I wanted to tell her , I wrote at the bottom , `` Love , Caitlin '' because my name is Caitlin . I licked the sticky part on the envelope and them pressed it down to seal the envelope . I wrote my address in the top left corner of the envelope , then my friends address in the center . In the top right corner I placed a stamp .|What was the mail carrier to pick up?|a piece of paper|0

I went to get dressed this morning . There was nothing to wear . All my clothes were dirty ! I knew I finally needed to do the laundry . I brought the basket into the laundry room . Once in the laundry room , I sorted out the clothing . I put one batch of clothing in the washer with the detergent . It was time to dry them . I put the wet clothes into the dryer and I loaded another batch in the washer . I waited for the clothes to wash and dry . Some of the clothes needed to be hung up . Finally , I brought the clothes into my room and I put them away . It was nice to finally have clean clothes !|What did they put in the basket?|dirty clothes|1

Before I go grocery shopping I make a list . I actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know I am out or low on something . I try to only go once a week unless there is something I really need for a specific meal . I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . Good to have a little bit of patience . I try to remember to bring my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting plastic bags .|What does the person not like to jump?|aisles|0

I got my shirt out of the dryer and noticed that one of the buttons was almost all the way off . I took the shirt and the button out of the dryer and laid it on my table . Then I went to my sewing box and found a needle and some thread that matched the shirt . I tied both ends together and was ready to sew the button back on . I put the button in the place I wanted , and inserted the needle up through the shirt and one of the holes . I put the needle back down through the hole diagonal from the one I just came through . I brought the needle up through one of the holes I had n't yet went through , and then back down through the hole diagonal to it . I ended up on the backside of the shirt , and went through a couple of threads to tie it off .

Last night I went out for what I hoped would be an amazing steak dinner . I had been hoping to try a new restaurant in my neighborhood called Strip . They are known for their variety of steaks cooked to order and a very creative menu of side dishes . I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes . I drank water with dinner because I was driving last night . When my steak arrived I eagerly cut into it expecting it to be cooked exactly as I had ordered . Instead it was cooked well done , very well done . It is really rare that I send food back however this steak was not at all what I had ordered and something that I knew I would n't enjoy . I sent it back and it was replaced quickly with a steak cooked perfectly to my tastes .|when was the bite taking|When they were driving|0

We all went to the theater the other day to see a fun play . It was a trip that our family had been planning for quite some time and we were all excited to get out and go ! Our plan was to go see a new action movie that was playing in town . It was made by one of our favorite companies , and we all knew that it would be a great time to spend with each other . I sang louder than every body else in the car , just because I thought it would be the best thing to do at the time . When we got the the theater I was almost too excited to get in ! I was hopping around and I just could not contain all of my pure excitement .|Where were the people going in the car?|A grocery store|0

The Long Awaited Bath I had been outside working in my garden all day . It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt , I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good . I wanted to get everything done in one day so I had worked very hard for a very long time . However , when I went inside to clean up , I realized from an automated message in my voice mail that the water had been shut off temporarily for emergency repairs , it would be on again in a few hours . I was frustrated , but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made myself a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat . I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked . I ran myself a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in it . I got in and found it very relaxing . I was so glad to finally take a bath , get cleaned up , and relax after a long , hard , productive day .|When did they stop dealing with the stench|after they took a bath|1

I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked . I ran myself a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in it . I got in and found it very relaxing . I was so glad to finally take a bath , get cleaned up , and relax after a long , hard , productive day .|What did they watch?|They watched television on the couch|1
The Long Awaited Bath I had been outside working in my garden all day . It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt , I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good .

Paying taxes is something everyone who works has to do every year . Once a year , the business you work for will give you a form called a W-2 . Sometimes there are more forms , but you will always have a W-2 . These forms show the amount of money you have earned and the amount of money you have paid in taxes . Sometimes people pay too much , and sometimes people pay too little . Doing taxes corrects for that . To figure out if you paid too much , not enough , or just the right amount I like to use computer software . It is very easy . The computer screen will ask a series of questions and tell you which numbered box on your form you can find that answer . If you paid too little , you will have to pay the government money , but usually people have paid too much and get money back .|When does the computer calculate whether they paid enough?|After the info is entered|1

My cousin and I decided to go fishing . It was going to be a warm day so we got started early . My cousin attached his boat to his car , a Ford Tempo . We loaded the boat up with our fishing gear , some snacks and drinks , and our bucket of bait . We spent a few hours fishing on the lake , taking turns casting our rods out over the water . My cousin caught two fish , but I didnt catch any . By then the sun was making it very warm on the water , so we headed back to the shore . My cousin backed his Ford Tempo almost into the water to hook the boat back up . Then we drove home and ate the fish for dinner .|How did they get the boat into the water?|with a Ford Tempo|1

My cousin backed his Ford Tempo almost into the water to hook the boat back up . Then we drove home and ate the fish for dinner .|Where did they drive to put the boat in the water?|to the lake|1

My dad got up Saturday morning and said , " Come on son , you 're going to have your first golf lesson today . " Dad said to wear some jeans and a shirt and we put sunscreen on . Then off in the car and we went to the nearby golf course . Dad pulled out his clubs from the trunk and said we would have to rent some smaller ones for me . Dad took me to the driving range and showed me how to hit the ball . I practiced and practiced and finally dad said I was ready for my first game . There was hardly anyone on the course because we came extra early dad said , so we could take our time . I hit my first ball and it did n't go far enough but dad helped me get through nine holes and it was a lot of fun .|When were they all set with clubs?|after golfing|0

When I do n't feel well and I am sure I am sick I will go to the doctor or a walk in clinic to see a nurse . They will usually ask me a few questions and check my temperature and my glands to see how I am doing . They ascertain when i started to feel bad and what symptoms I have . From this they can work out more or less what 's wrong with me and what they can do for me , particularly what medication they should give me . After I leave the doctor or nurse 's office , I usually head to the chemist or pharmacy and collect the medicine they have scripted for me . Then I head home , take the medicine according to the specific instructions and dosage they have recommended and I usually prepare for bed . I like to sleep when I 'm sick and just wake up to take medicine or talk to my boyfriend . He usually makes sure that I eat when I am sick .|What is being taken?|food|0

Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some books . All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I had to take the bus . First thing was to see what bus I needed . I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all .|When did they pull up the bus schedules for their city?|Before going to the library|1

Yesterday after lunch I decided I wanted a book to read . I went to my local library and browsed the shelves for something I would enjoy reading . After finding my favorite section of the library I looked at the titles of each book . I picked out a book I thought sounded interesting and read the back cover to make sure the story sounded amusing . I took the book up to the front of the library where the librarian sat at her desk . I informed her that I found the book I wanted and was ready to check out . She scanned the bar code on the book and let me know it was due to be returned in five days .|What did they read?|Back of the book|1

After finding my favorite section of the library I looked at the titles of each book . I picked out a book I thought sounded interesting and read the back cover to make sure the story sounded amusing . I took the book up to the front of the library where the librarian sat at her desk . I informed her that I found the book I wanted and was ready to check out . She scanned the bar code on the book and let me know it was due to be returned in five days .|When did they leave the library to go read their book?|After checking out the book|1
Talking on the phone has always been a regular part of my life . I use the phone every single day to talk to my parents , and occasionally to talk to my friends and other relatives . Just last week , I got a phone call from a friend that lives in my old home town . The phone number was unknown to me , and the only thing I recognized was the area code . Because of this , I answered the phone and was pleasantly surprised to hear the voice of one of my good friends on the other line . Once I knew that it was in fact one of my friends , we talked on the phone for about 2 hours just trying to catch up with what we 've been doing . By the time I hung up the phone , I was happy knowing that I got to talk to an old friend .|When did they receive a phone call?|Just last week|1

Beth and Tim usually prepare dinner almost every night at their house . They have two children , and when they get home at night from work , Beth and Tim usually start by getting out the pots and pans to cook with . They look into their refrigerator , and see what they have to cook that night . They put all the food onto the counter , and started to wash the vegetables first . Then they cut up the vegetables to make a salad . They put the salad to the side , and made sure that they had some salad dressing in the refrigerator , so that they could use that for the salad . Next , they heated up the oven , and put the steaks into the oven on high heat . It did n't take long for the steaks to cook , and then they cut up pieces of bread with butter , and put the food on plates to feed everyone .|What did they pick out besides steak and bread?|salad|1

Our bedroom was starting to look shoddy . It needed a new coat of paint and new carpeting . We went to the hardware store and picked out a light-blue paint for the walls and an off-white color for the ceiling . Then we went to pick out the new carpet . We also picked out new light fixtures and light-switches . Then we got to work ripping up all of the old carpeting . Once that was up , we put painter 's tape down to protect the floor and fixtures , and to keep the corners of the room clean . After that , we put paint into a paint tray and painted the ceiling with a roller . Once we completed the paint job , we laid down the new carpet . We finished up by putting in the new fixtures and light switches . Our bedroom looks much nicer now .|When did they get started on the walls?|after painting the ceiling|1

When I went to pay for gas , first I pulled my car up to the pump and selected that I wanted to use my credit card to pay at the pump . But , for some reason the card reader at the gas pump was n't working . So I went inside . I told the cashier that the reader was broken , and they told me that they would look into it . I walked back outside to my car , selected the grade of gas I wanted , pulled the nozzle off the pump , put the nozzle in my car , then pulled the lever to start pumping gas . I filled my car up , and still had some gas I paid for , but I knew it would get paid back to me so I hung the pump up .

I walked back outside to my car , selected the grade of gas I wanted , pulled the nozzle off the pump , put the nozzle in my car , then pulled the lever to start pumping gas . I filled my car up , and still had some gas I paid for , but I knew it would get paid back to me so I hung the pump up . I declined a receipt at the pump , then got into my car and left .|What was being pumped?|Gasoline|1

Video games is something that became popular within the last 40 or so years and the technology has come a VERY long way . When I was growing up I played a lot of video games on my Super Nintendo , then my Playstation and then my Playstation 2 . Since I finished High School and started working though I gave them a break as I prefer to do something more productive with my time . Especially when I was on break from school or on the weekends when I had no friends or family to play with it was the perfect thing for me to do to occupy my time . I used to love playing sports video games as I was and am a huge sports fan . I loved NFL Madden , NHL , MLB and NBA Live games and played them the most of any others .|When did they spend hours on video games?|after work|0

I cooked dinner for myself last night . It was a simple affair of packaged ramen , with some additional ingredients thrown in . First , I boiled a bit more than two cups of water , which was slightly above what the package called for . I also added a handful of frozen mixed vegetables . I then cracked open three eggs into a bowl , and sliced four hot dogs into diagonal slices . Once the water was boiling I added both the block of dried ramen and the seasoning packets from the package . I also added the sliced hot dogs , as well as two slices of Swiss cheese to give the broth more flavoring and creaminess . Finally , I poured the three eggs from the bowl into the pot and let it boil for an additional minute and a half before taking it off the heat . That way the egg whites would firm up , but the yolk would remain runny .|What did they season the water with?|Hot dogs.|0

When I went on vacation , I picked out a number of places that I wanted to visit and see . I made preparations by looking online first to determine which ones were the most important to me , and also which would be convenient for me to see if I have a chance . I make a list and then when I went on vacation , I took that list with me . I would drive for a while , and then stop and visit those sights . While there , I was able to take pictures as much as I wanted . Even though I was on a schedule , it was very nice to take the time to visit these spots . I also had the best souvenir , which was a group of pictures , that allowed me to revisit those places again in my mind at a later time .|What could the person plot out?|the seating chart|0

The first thing I do is try to rinse off all the dishes , but not too much because you 're supposed to leave a little gunk on the plates to help the dishwasher wash them better . So I load each dish where it 's supposed to go . I place the bowels on the top facing each other .  Then I put glasses and cups on top as well on each side of the bowels which are in the middle .  Then I load the bottom portion .  Here , I place large plates on one side facing one direction , then more plates facing the other plates .  Then I place the silverware in the silverware rack in the middle . Then I get one of those little dish washing gel pods that I place in the circle that 's on the door .

Once my laundry has dried , I then need to fold my clothes . First I take the clothing that needs to be folded out of the dryer . I place all of the clothing on top of the dryer in a pile so that I have easy access to it . I usually start with pants . When I fold pants , I take both legs and fold them together , and then I bring both pant legs up to the waist and I have completed folding my pants . With shirts , I always fluff them out by giving them a good wave in the air . Once I do that , I then place the shirt face down on top of the dryer . I begin by folding in the sleeves and then I fold the bottom about half way up . I then fold in each side . Once all of my clothing has been folded , I place them in my laundry basket and bring them to my room to be put away .

There are a lot of vending machines where I live , and so I buy from them from time to time . Buying from a vending machine is easy when it is working . The last place I bought from a vending machine was at my school , it sells little snacks and drinks so that I do n't get hungry . After I put in the money I looked at all the choices in the machine , there was candy , nuts , crackers , and gum . I decided I wanted some candy and so I looked at what number it was and typed the number into the vending machine 's key pad . The vending machine took the candy and dispensed it for me and it fell to the bottom where I was able to pick it up . I then got my change back .|When did they put the money in the machine?|when they don't want snacks|0

I placed the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room and started in . I first sorted out types of clothes from the basket - shirts in one pile , pants in another , and socks and underwear in another . I took a t-shirt out of the pile , flipped it over so that the back of the shirt was facing me and laid it out flat on the table . I then folded the right arm straight down so that the arm of the shirt faced the middle , then the left side so that it looked like the arms were crossed on the shirt . I picked it up , flipped it back over and the shirt was perfectly folded ! Boy this task was getting boring - I decided to do this while watching TV and moved the basket , and piles of clothing that were already folded to a nice comfy big chair , turned the TV on , found a favorite program and plopped down to continue the task of folding clothes . Ahhh much better ! Then came a pair of pants which I held up in front of me , folding the side-seems of the legs so that they met together at the legs . I put the pants in a stack of the same type of clothing that had already been folded and continued getting all those clothes folded and ready to put away . Next came socks , find the mate to the sock needing to be folded , put them together and take one sock , folding the top over the other like you are making a cuff after you have put it on your foot , keep pushing the other sock in so that it looks like you have a small ball when you are done . Yaaay , socks are all done , now it 's underwear next ! I pulled a pair of panties out of the basket , laid it out flat and then folded each side so that it met in the middle , then the bottom so that it to met in the middle then flipped it over , and started a pile of freshly folded underthings . For things like bras , I folded the cups together , the back so that it fit inside the cup , and the straps down . Soon with the help of glancing at the favorite TV program , the basket was empty , and laundry all folded - yippeeee !|What was being folded?|legs|0

I was babysitting my nephew one night while my sister and brother in law went out on a date . I had fed him , burped him and played with him . We were in the middle of a peek a boo game when I smelled something off . I went to the hallway and grabbed his diaper bag . Then , I took out his green changing mat . I searched through the bag and grabbed a clean diaper , the wipes and some baby powder . He was awfully wriggly , so I knew I 'd have to do this quickly ! I took off his dirty diaper . Then , I took out a wipe from the container and wiped his backside . When I was sure he was clean enough , I put the clean diaper under him and sprinkled baby powder over him .|They knew who needed their diaper changed?|Her nephew|1

I was babysitting my nephew one night while my sister and brother in law went out on a date . I had fed him , burped him and played with him . We were in the middle of a peek a boo game when I smelled something off . I went to the hallway and grabbed his diaper bag . Then , I took out his green changing mat . I searched through the bag and grabbed a clean diaper , the wipes and some baby powder . He was awfully wriggly , so I knew I 'd have to do this quickly ! I took off his dirty diaper . Then , I took out a wipe from the container and wiped his backside . When I was sure he was clean enough , I put the clean diaper under him and sprinkled baby powder over him .|What did they secure after putting on?|the clean diaper|1

Last time I fed the fish , I was at the river near my boat in New Jersey . As I sat on the back of my boat , I could see some fish jumping out of the water . I ripped up some pieces of bread and started to throw them into the river . I could see many fish jumping out of the water and eating the food . This was a fun experience and I went through a couple pieces of bread by giving them to the fishes . My sister saw me and first questioned what I was doing , but soon after , she was helping me feed the fishes as well . I did this for about ten minutes before stopping and it was fun .|Where was the food thrown?|into the river|1

Babies are very little humans that have to grow bigger and stronger before they are able to do the same things as us . When a baby is small they need help eating . After they have eaten they will need to go to the bathroom like grownups . However , because they can not stand or sit by themselves , their mothers and fathers let them wear large plastic pants that the babies use to pee or poop in . After the baby has used their pants to go to the bathroom someone must change the plastic pants and put clean ones on the baby . The parent or helper will gently lay the baby on their back , usually on a padded table . Then the helper will take the plastic pants off the baby . The baby will need to be cleaned . Usually someone will use a towel that has been moistened to wipe the baby 's rear end and legs and anywhere else that is soiled . Then the parent or helper will gently lift the baby 's bottom and slide another pair of clean plastic pants under the baby 's bottom . Now the baby is clean !|when will the baby cry if their diaper is not changed?|Before it has been soiled.|0

Babies are very little humans that have to grow bigger and stronger before they are able to do the same things as us . When a baby is small they need help eating . After they have eaten they will need to go to the bathroom like grownups . However , because they can not stand or sit by themselves , their mothers and fathers let them wear large plastic pants that the babies use to pee or poop in . After the baby has used their pants to go to the bathroom someone must change the plastic pants and put clean ones on the baby . The parent or helper will gently lay the baby on their back , usually on a padded table . Then the helper will take the plastic pants off the baby . The baby will need to be cleaned . Usually someone will use a towel that has been moistened to wipe the baby 's rear end and legs and anywhere else that is soiled . Then the parent or helper will gently lift the baby 's bottom and slide another pair of clean plastic pants under the baby 's bottom . Now the baby is clean !|What will cry if their pants are not changed?|the baby|1
Some people do this differently , but the way I do it is this : I keep my big plastic garbage can in my garage . The garbage man come once a week to pick up everyone 's trash and that 's every Wednesday morning . So throughout the week I have a big trash bag upstairs in the kitchen and about three smaller garbage cans for the bathrooms . Every few days I 'll take them down to the garage and put them in the big plastic can . Then on Wednesday morning ( sometimes I have to set an alarm on my phone because I forget ) I 'll open the garage door and take the can ( as well as the recycle can when it 's full ) and set the cans out by the curb for the garbage men to pick up . Then the truck comes by and lifts it with a mechanical arm and places all the trash in the back of the truck .|What do they take back into the garage?|The trash|0

My neighbors recently adopted a puppy and asked me to help training him , since we have a dog who is very well-behaved . I went over to their house and asked where they keep the dog treats . We started with some basic commands , like " sit " and " stay . " When he did the right thing , we gave him a treat . To train him to stay , we took him outside , where he likes to run around . We told him to sit , and gave him a treat , then started to toss a ball around . We told the dog to stay , because we knew he 'd be full of energy and would try to catch the ball that we were tossing . He was n't perfect this first time , but after several weeks , he was perfectly trained !|When did the person give the dog a treat?|when he got to his house|0

Yesterday I went grocery shopping . I left my house and drove to the store . I parked the car , walked inside and grabbed a shopping cart . I picked out the best looking strawberries , they were on sale for $ 2 a pound . I bought several pounds because my daughter loves fresh strawberries . I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed . When I had found everything I needed , and put them in my cart , I walked over to the checkout lanes . Finally , it was my turn and the checkout person checked me out . I paid my bill , and walked out to my car with the shopping cart . Then I loaded the car up with the groceries , returned the cart and drove home .|What did they look at to determine they needed produce?|washing machine|0

We have an acre of land with a half of it devoted to a flower garden with paths and bushes and flowers . One day a little kitten came up to my mom while she was gardening and became her buddy in the summer . Her buddy would keep visiting us all through the fall and into the winter . She grew up to being a quite nice independent cat and we fed her as she was always hungry when she came to our house . She lived in the house across the street that had 9 people and 3 dogs and another cat living in it . She did n't seem very happy there , especially with a 2 year old that chased her and grabbed her . The other people in the house agreed we could keep the cat and she has been so happy with us . I 'm not so sure if we adopted her or she adopted us !|What did the 2 year old's mom own?|the flower garden|0

On Saturday , we went to a fast food restaurant Smashburger . We had seen commercials for it on television , so we wanted to try it . When we got up to the counter , we were handed menus . The milkshakes looked good , but I did n't want to get too much food and feel sick afterward . I decided to get a burger , fries , and a soda . My partner got the same , but with seasoned fries instead of regular fries . We gave our orders to the woman behind the counter , paid , and waited until our food was ready . We both liked our food , although we did like the burgers better than the fries . When we were done , we waited to see what we should do with our garbage because we did n't see trash cans . We noticed that the people who work at the restaurant take away trash after customers are done eating , so we left our trays on the table .|what are the menus used for?|To clean hands|0

I work at a daycare and it is my job to take care of kids who are two and three . I have 10 kids in my class , five boys and five girls . Our day is long sometimes because the kids get there really early so their parents can go to work .  In the mornings its still dark out so we let the kids go back to sleep when they get dropped off .  I have to go into the kitchen part of our room and get out all the cereal and milk . Next i set the table and then I wake up the kids . After the kids eat breakfast we all pitch in and clean up while we sing a clean up song .  The next part of our day we spend outside if it is nice , we run around play games and exercise .  Almost like the morning time but nap first and then eat . After lunchtime we play again . And then we rest gain till parents get here .|What happens before lunch?|they nap|1

Next i set the table and then I wake up the kids . After the kids eat breakfast we all pitch in and clean up while we sing a clean up song .  The next part of our day we spend outside if it is nice , we run around play games and exercise .  Almost like the morning time but nap first and then eat . After lunchtime we play again . And then we rest gain till parents get here .|How long where they sleeping?|all day|0

I needed to clean up my flat . I had to get my broom and vacuum and all the cleaners I would need . I started by going around and picking up any garbage I seem , like used candy wrappers and old bottles of water.I threw them away . I went around and picked up and dishes that were out and put them in the sink then washed them . I used my broom to sweep up all the dust and dirt off the floors the hard floors , and the vacuum to clean up the floors that had rugs and carpets . When the hard floors were swept , I used a bucket with floor cleaner and water , and a mop , to mop them up . The t.v. , the tables and counters and everything else that was a hard surface , I used the rag to dust . My flat looked very nice when it was clean .|What did they dust with the rug in the room?|the tv, tables, and counters|1

The last time I made toast , I was really in the mood for it . I was n't very hungry , but knew that I should eat something small and as a result , I decided to make toast . This was an easy process and began with me taking bread from the top of the refrigerator and putting it in the toaster oven . I get the process started by turning on the toaster to where it says toast and letting the bread stay in there until the buzzer goes off . Once it was ready , I grabbed the glove for the heat and used it to take out the toast . I then closed the door on the toaster and let the toast sit for a few minutes before eating it . It tasted really good and it was easy to make .|When was it ready?|when the toaster oven was turned on|0

To clean a floor , like my kitchen floor , I use several steps . First , I use a broom to get any dust or crumbs off of the floor . I sweep the crumbs into a dustpan and empty the dustpan into the garbage can . I fill the bucket with warm water and mix about a quarter of a cup of floor cleaning liquid with it . I dip the mop into the cleaning solution in the bucket and remove it , draining any extra water back into the bucket , Then I move the wet mop around on the floor to clean it . I dip the mop back into the bucket to rinse the dirt from mop and drain it again before moving the mop over the floor again .|What gets repeated many times?|filling the bucket with warm water|0

I wanted to use my camera to take photos of my garden . The camera would not turn on and the red battery light was flashing . I realized that I needed to change the batteries because I had not changed them in a few months . I opened the battery compartment of the camera , and removed the old batteries . I threw the old batteries away so they would not get mixed up . I put new batteries in the camera , checked to make sure they were facing the right way , and then closed the compartment . The camera turned on and I put the battery box away before going outside . I then took pictures of my garden with my camera that now had working batteries .|They pressed the "on" button of the camera to make sure the what worked?|the garden|0

Last week we planned for a picnic in our family . As part of it , we wanted some drink to get prepared . Instead of buying bottled juice , we planned to prepare fresh orange juice . Our parents shopped good , fresh oranges . I and Kevin peeled the oranges well . Once we done peeling all the oranges , we blend them all using a blender . Kevin tasted the juice and complained that the juice was very tangy . So we added some water and sugar to it to get good taste . If we add more water , the taste of the juice will get spoiled . Finally we got good taste . We asked our mom to taste the juice and finalize it . She also liked the juice and we were very happy on the preparation of our first fresh orange juice .|What did they filter?|blender|0

Kevin tasted the juice and complained that the juice was very tangy . So we added some water and sugar to it to get good taste . If we add more water , the taste of the juice will get spoiled . Finally we got good taste . We asked our mom to taste the juice and finalize it . She also liked the juice and we were very happy on the preparation of our first fresh orange juice .|How did they add the water?|with a bucket|0

I am a school teacher , and I often have to give presentations to my students . These presentations are always about some field of science , because I am a science teacher . Teaching is n't just about the presentation itself , it also means that I have to have a lot of interesting things for my students to look at . My teacher equipment includes things like bones , insect specimens , and rocks and minerals . After I have written out what I am going to speak to the students about , I have to decide which equipment to use . One day I might give a big talk on insects . I get them out of their boxes and get them ready to pass around so my students can look at them while I talk about insects . That way everything is ready and I do n't have to go looking for anything . I keep the boxes nearby so that after my presentation I can put away my equipment .|When did they look?|during class|1

Today , I had to go to the store to get some groceries . The grocery store is all the way across town , so I had to drive my car to get there . This morning , it was really cold out , so I unlocked my car , got inside , and turned on the ignition , by putting the key in and turning . The heat came on and it got warm again . I shifted the car into reverse , using the gear shifter and carefully backed out of my driveway . I then put the car into drive and headed to the grocery store . I used my turn signal to turn right onto main street , and waved as I passed my neighbor going the other direction . I turned the steering wheel to direct my car into a parking space , then got out and locked my car using the clicker . I then bought my groceries , loaded them into my trunk , and drove back home .|Where did they make it quickly to?|the park|0

This morning , it was really cold out , so I unlocked my car , got inside , and turned on the ignition , by putting the key in and turning . The heat came on and it got warm again . I shifted the car into reverse , using the gear shifter and carefully backed out of my driveway . I then put the car into drive and headed to the grocery store . I used my turn signal to turn right onto main street , and waved as I passed my neighbor going the other direction . I turned the steering wheel to direct my car into a parking space , then got out and locked my car using the clicker . I then bought my groceries , loaded them into my trunk , and drove back home .|When was it driven?|Last week.|0

I needed groceries , so I went to the store and did my weekly grocery shopping . After buying everything on my list , I drove home and got the groceries out of the car . I put all of the bags down on the kitchen table and began putting the groceries away . I always did this first since I did n't want items like ice cream to start melting . Then I put cold items , like milk , away in the refrigerator . I had to rearrange some items that were already in the refrigerator so everything would fit . I try to keep the pantry shelves organized , so I can easily find things when I need them . I put away a bag of flour , some boxes of pasta , and a box of cookies . I was glad when I was done .|What did they put away first?|milk|0

I went to the bank this morning to withdraw money to buy a car . I went to the first counter and got a withdraw slip . I needed to get my account number from my purse to be able to fill out the slip completely . I was about five people back but the line seemed to be moving quickly . When it was finally my turn I handed my withdraw slip to the teller . She was n't very friendly and seemed to be rushing . It makes me nervous when they rush at the bank because what if they do n't count my money correctly ? She seemed annoyed when she asked for two forms of identification to be able to access my account and I had to dig around in my purse to find my wallet . She asked me to wait while she goes and gets the money . She finally came back and counted my money out for me and told me to have a great day and rushed me out of the line immediately calling for the next person .|In addition to the bank card, what did they hand the teller?|money|0

I went to the mailbox and saw that there was mail . Looking through the stack of mail , I saw an envelope addressed to me . I opened the envelope and saw that it was a letter from my cousin .  I opened the envelope 's seal with my finger , and took out the letter which was folded in 3 .  Her letter was three pages long ! She told me about all of the rides she went on , and all of the food she had . I wished that I was there , but I was glad she had fun on vacation .  When I was done reading the letter , I folded it back up and put it back in the envelope so I could save it .  I put the letter in my room so it would always remind me that I had to write her back .|What did the letter tell her all about?|her cousins vacation|1

I opened the envelope 's seal with my finger , and took out the letter which was folded in 3 .  Her letter was three pages long ! She told me about all of the rides she went on , and all of the food she had . I wished that I was there , but I was glad she had fun on vacation .  When I was done reading the letter , I folded it back up and put it back in the envelope so I could save it .

My sister and I decided that it would be a nice day to hang out to the beach . We wanted to be prepared , so we began to grab the items that we would need for the day . First , I went to my room to find my swimsuit , my sandals , my sunglasses , and my tote bag . Then , I grabbed a beach towel for each of us from the linen closet in the hallway . My sister reminded me that we need to protect our skin from the sun , so I went to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet to look for the sunscreen . I took it from the bottom shelf and threw it into my tote bag . We left our house , and walked for about 10 minutes until we got to the beach . Once we arrived at the beach , we had to look for a place to set down our things . My sister saw some of her friends , so we walked over to where they were sitting and placed our beach towels on the sand next to them . My sister had to put the sunscreen on my back for me . I put on my sunglasses , and laid down to relax in the sun . It was a fun day .|What was put on feet?|sunscreen.|0

I went to my brother 's wedding , the only time I was ever a groomsman . It was great , because I felt special . I did n't feel as special on the other weddings .  But for the other two siblings , I was an usher , which I really hated anyway . I as an usher for this wedding too , which is a really dumb thing . It was n't my wedding , but it was uncomfortable for me and i 'm sure it was for the other people too .  I was n't on the stage but was in the seat for the other ones . Considering I do n't get an invite for other weddings , I am glad that I at least got into the other ones . This one the only way I was singled out was that I did n't get a golf gift , which I suppose is a traddition ?|What did they feel good on?|Usher|0

This one the only way I was singled out was that I did n't get a golf gift , which I suppose is a traddition ?|How was the groomsman related to the groom?|He was his brother|1
I went to my brother 's wedding , the only time I was ever a groomsman . It was great , because I felt special . I did n't feel as special on the other weddings .  But for the other two siblings , I was an usher , which I really hated anyway . I as an usher for this wedding too , which is a really dumb thing .

I wanted to buy a tree for my backyard garden . Before heading to the store , I went into the backyard and looked at my garden from several different angles . Then I got into my car and headed to the nearby home and garden center . While I was looking , I pictured my garden in my mind to help figure out the size of tree I wanted to buy . I looked through several sections but did n't find anything that I liked yet . Some of the trees were too small and would have had to struggle for sunlight . Some of the trees were too delicate and would have been too hard to take care of . In the next section , I found the perfect tree . It was just the right size and it did n't need a lot of special attention . I took it home and planted it .|What was the perfect addition?|a tree that didn't need a lot of special attention|1

August is back to school time in my city , and back to school means back to school shopping . My daughter and I went through all of her clothes and shoes to see what she has that she can use this year , and what we need to give away . Once we knew what she could use , we made a list of what she needed ( and some things she wanted ) .  Based on the list of needs and want , we decided which stores we would visit .  Once we arrived at the first store , we browsed through the clothes on the racks looking for the styles and sizes that would best suit my daughter . She picked a few things , and we headed for the dressing room . She tried on each of the items she had selected , and if she liked the item , we checked the price tag .  If the item was too expensive , we put it in the reject pile . After she tried on everything we had taken into the dressing room , we took our purchase pile to the customer service counter to pay for our items . Then we moved on to the next store , and repeated the process until we had found everything on our list .|They set off in their car to go where?|School|0

I wanted to make some tea . First , I checked the shelves with colorful boxes of tea bags to decide what kind of tea I wanted . There were mostly orange boxes containing orange pekoe tea . The boxes with an earth toned nature picture on them contained herbal tea . I took an herbal tea box off the shelf , opened the box and took out a tea bag . Then I went to the cupboard and took out a yellow microwavable mug . I put the mug in the microwave oven on high for two minutes . I then put the mug on a saucer and let it sit for ten or fifteen minutes until the tea got darker . It took awhile for the tea to finish brewing , as it is not necessary to heat it for the whole time , since it it is still very hot when it comes out of the microwave . Then I drank the herbal tea .|What was put into the water?|The tea bag.|1

It was Thanksgiving and I spent all morning in the kitchen creating the perfect meal . My husband set the table but he stayed out of the kitchen and let me do my work . At 1:00 , my family gathered around the table . Then my husband helped me bring out the mashed potatoes , sweet potatoes , cranberry relish , rolls , butter , buttered peas , green bean casserole , gravy and sausage stuffing . We put everything on the table and my husband carved the turkey . He put a slab of turkey on each plate and then the sides were passed around for people to help themselves to what they wanted . After everyone ate , I cleared the table and bought out a pumpkin pie and an apple pie . I served what each person wanted and once dessert was finished we all pushed away from the table , stuffed .|When was the turkey baked to a crispy, golden brown?|On Thanksgiving day|1

I woke up this morning to the sounds of my dog barking . He was ready for his morning walk . I got dressed and walked to the door . He was surely ready . I put his leash on his collar and opened the door . He walked out the door and I followed him . I closed and locked the door behind us before we left . We walked to the park that is down the road from my house . When we got to the park , we took the trail that wraps around the lake that is there . After a while , I decided it was time to go home . I unlocked the door and we went back inside . He was excited about his walk and ready for a drink of water .|Where did the dog have the leash?|on the collar|1

I had friends over the first time in my new town , and they were thirsty . Because I wanted to be a good hostess , I asked everybody what they wanted to drink . We had Coke , orange juice , and water . After everyone told me what they wanted , I went into the kitchen and pulled five cups down from the cupboard . My mom had a tray she used for parties , so I pulled that down from the cupboard , too . I took the Coke out of the fridge and poured it into two cups , then added some ice cubes from the freezer . I poured that into one cup and added more ice cubes before putting the pitcher in the fridge again . Finally , I pulled out the orange juice carton and filled the last two cups . Then I put the carton back in the fridge and the five cups on the tray . When I got there , I set the tray down on the coffee table and handed out the first drink . I 'd served my very first drink to my first new friends at my first fun get together in my new town !|What did they put back in the fridge?|The tray.|0

I had friends over the first time in my new town , and they were thirsty . Because I wanted to be a good hostess , I asked everybody what they wanted to drink . We had Coke , orange juice , and water . After everyone told me what they wanted , I went into the kitchen and pulled five cups down from the cupboard . My mom had a tray she used for parties , so I pulled that down from the cupboard , too . I took the Coke out of the fridge and poured it into two cups , then added some ice cubes from the freezer . I poured that into one cup and added more ice cubes before putting the pitcher in the fridge again . Finally , I pulled out the orange juice carton and filled the last two cups .

My car was in the shop , so today I decided to commute to school on a public bus . First , I looked up what bus I would need . I found I need to take two buses and transfer in the middle . It came on time , and the bus driver let off the other passengers . I stepped onto the bus and paid the driver the fare . Then I found an open seat by a window and sat down . Then the driver announced my stop . I headed out the back doors . Outside , I found a bench and sat down . The next bus came fairly quickly . This time , the bus was packed , so I found a pole and hung on . The ride was n't too long , however , and soon I was at my final destination . I found my way off the bus and walked over to school .|Who did they show their transfer ticket?|bus driver|1

Depending on the breed of dog , it could be very hard to train a dog . Of course , it is best to train a dog as a puppy so they know the rules early on . Once the dog is older , they are already set in their ways and it could be very difficult to train them to do new things .  Lets start with an eating schedule . Most dogs will want to eat anything in front of them at any time , but you must train them to eat at certain times , and where they will get their meals . By putting a bowl of food out at the same time , each day , the dog will get used to eating at those times .  If the dog does n't eat when they are supposed to , remove their bowl after 15 minutes . They will learn for next time , if they do n't eat when food is given to them , they do n't get to eat .|When will the dog eat a healthy meal?|before meal time|0

Going for a walk is fun and can be a good way to get some energy out . My three children are often in the house and I find a nice walk is fun for everyone . On Sunday evening after everyone had eaten dinner the whole family decided to go for a walk . I reminded my children not to run in the street and to stay close . We all walked around the neighborhood . We said hi to the passerby 's as they came . We all walked for a good half an hour before the youngest child , my daughter was getting hot and tired . We headed home and we happy to have gotten our exercise and spend time as a family . Feeling the sunshine and the breeze was a perfect way to end the day .|When did they get their shoes on?|after walking|0

Yesterday , I went with my brother , cousin and 5 other friends grabbed a football and went to the park . When we got there , we selected two of our friends , Joe and Bill , to be the team captains . Joe and Bill took turns selecting players . I got selected to Bill 's team , but was picked last . We also decided to not to play tackle because we did n't want anyone to get hurt . So instead , we decided that you only had to be touched with two hands to be „ down . " \ nOur team kicked off and started on defense . We got the ball next but went 4 plays without scoring , so we lost the ball . The game went back and forth for awhile and we ended up losing 3 to 2 . After that , we shook hands and went home .|What score would somebody make?|1,721 to 1|0

Most of my bills are due during the first week of the month . After I get paid on the first of the month , I gather up all of my bills . Most of them I can pay for online , so I log in to the website for each bill .  The website gives me several options on how to pay . The easiest is to link the bill directly to my bank account .

So my wife and I decided that we wanted to have a fun get together with a few board games . We called our friends and asked what they would like to eat and what kind of food and drinks they would prefer . So they said pizza would be really good along with Coca Cola . Before they came over we cleaned our house and took out all the board games that we might play . Trivial Pursuit was one of them and so was Balderdash . We also had cards and Pictionary . Our guests were another married couple that we have been friends with for a long time . We sat and talked for awhile and then we had some pizza and talked some more . After we ate we decided to make some coffee and we dug into the dessert . We played Pictionary and Balderdash and we had a lot of fun !|What is delivered shortly after they arrived?|Coffee|0

For my brother 's birthday , we went to see a local jazz band at a bar in New Orleans . First we went and ate at a fancy restaurant . After that , we went to a bar to go watch a local New Orleans based jazz band perform at bar .  The band came out on stage and rocked the house for a solid 30 minutes before taking a brief intermission .  Also there was an NBA playoff basketball game between the Rockets and Trail Blazers playing on a television , so I decided to watch that during intermission . When the band came back on I went back to my table to watch them perform . They performed for another 45 minutes , then the concert was over .  We all agreed that the band was fantastic . It was a night well spent .|What is the destination?|New Orleans|1

At home , I have a 20-gallon fish tank filled with colorful tropical fish . I keep it in the living room on a special table where everyone can admire the fish . It makes me feel peaceful to sit and watch the fish as they drift and swim around . I have taken great care in selecting the fish that go into the tank , to make sure they will all get along . There is an expert at the fish store who gives me instructions on how to make sure the fish are happy and healthy in their environment . I love to lift the lid of the tank and sprinkle their special food onto the surface of the water . The fish rise to the surface and begin to eat the food . They know it 's dinner time , based on my motions and the lifting of the lid .|Who needs to get fed every day?|The Lion|0

It makes me feel peaceful to sit and watch the fish as they drift and swim around . I have taken great care in selecting the fish that go into the tank , to make sure they will all get along . There is an expert at the fish store who gives me instructions on how to make sure the fish are happy and healthy in their environment . I love to lift the lid of the tank and sprinkle their special food onto the surface of the water . The fish rise to the surface and begin to eat the food .

I have a cat and his name is Felix . He needs to get some food every day so that he stays alive . When I wake up in the morning it is my turn to feed Felix . It is a fishy one . Felix likes fishy food . I get the can opener and twist it so that the lid of the tin comes off . Felix has already smelled it and he is purring at my leg . I find Felix 's bowl and turn the tin over until the food drops out into the bowl . I mash it up a little with a fork and then put the bowl down beside Felix . He starts to eat right away . He must have been hungry .|What is inside that doesn't smell good?|candy|0

This past weekend , one of my best friends and band mates , Andrew , was getting married . I was really excited for him and could n't wait to see it . We had received an invitation to go a few weeks ago and took that invitation with us to find the church to go to . When we arrived , we entered the holy place and waited for the couple to arrive . They looked great together and went up to the altar . The elder gave them some great advice and told them that their marriage would be eternal . He than told them their promises they would make to each other and asked them if they would live those promises . Afterwards , we celebrated with a party at the bride 's house down the street .|Who are the people that agreed?|the entire band|0

Earlier today my friend and I went to the the movie theater . Before going , we looked at tickets online . There was a showing of `` The Mummy '' at 3 pm . We arrived at the theater 30 minutes early so we would n't be rushed . First we went to the ticket booth to pick up our tickets . We then walked to the concession stand to buy some snacks to eat during the movie . It was really expensive ! After buying our snacks , we decided to go into the theater . Because we were still early , we had no problem finding a seat . Both of us like to sit right in the middle of the theater , because it has the best view . The movie itself was just okay , but I still enjoyed the day because of the company of my friend .|What did they book?|Tickets for the movie.|1

I write down `` spaghetti '' as the first item on my shopping list . I will also need some tomatoes , garlic and celery for my spaghetti sauce . I add these items to my list . I think about other items I use every week . I look in the refrigerator and see that I do need to get some more milk . I add `` milk '' to my shopping list . Finally , I remember that I used the last of the toothpaste this morning .|Where is the spaghetti box?|in the refrigerator|0

Yesterday I tried to take pictures with my camera , but it would not turn on . I realized that the batteries might be dead , and I should change them . First , I removed the small door to the battery compartment to check what kinds of batteries were needed . Then I went to the hall closet , and took out two AA batteries . I went back to my camera , with the battery compartment open , and shook it gently until the dead batteries fell out . I then looked into the compartment to see which end of the battery should go in first . I slid a battery - side first into the right slot , and + side first into the left slot . I turned my camera on to check that the new batteries were working , and they seemed to work fine . I then took the old batteries and put them in the box of other old batteries to be recycled .|What was put on the compartment?|The new batteries|1

I was hungry for lunch so I decided to make a sandwich . I went to the refrigerator and got the bread , cheese , mayonnaise , mustard , and meat to make it . Since I like my bread toasted , I put it in the toaster . Next up I layer the bottom piece of bread with cheese and meat . But wait , my sandwich looks like its missing something . Now I know its missing some color . So I wash out some lettuce and tomatoes and onions for my sandwich . Once done , I now layer the vegetables on my sandwich and close it with the top piece . Oh wait I need a few more things to make my lunch complete . Back to the refrigerator I go and grab the peppers and over to the pantry for potato chips . I guess I will need a drink to go with this lunch so I grab a water bottle .|When do potato chips go with their sandwich?|before the sandwich is eaten|0

When I was younger , I thought that any animal could be considered a pet . I was also scared that I would n't be able to take care of a dog , though , so I constantly asked my parents for pet fish . I asked for fish because I thought that they would be easy to take care of . When I was about 7 years old , my parents bought a huge aquarium and put it in our living room , and later that day , we went to the store and picked up some fish to put into it . Every now and then during the day , I would take the fish flakes that we bought from the same store and sprinkle enough into the tank for all the little fish to eat some . I did this every day that we had that aquarium .|What did the parents give to them?|a large aquarium and fish|1

There are many kids of drinks and they can be served in many ways . They can be self-serve , prepared to order , or many prepared and put out for others to partake . A first step is to obtain a clean glass or cup , ( depending on the beverage ) and the ingredients for the drink you will serve . If it 's a cold drink you want to keep it cold and if it 's a hot one you want to keep it hot , so you select what you might need for this purpose . You might want to include ice or chilled glasses , or potholders or a trivet if something is very hot . You will also want to protect the surface the beverage will rest on so you might want to supply small napkins or coasters . When your supplies for preparing and serving the drink are assembled sometimes you simply pour the beverage into the serving container and serve it , or you need to mix or prepare the beverage and then pour it into the serving container and then present it either to your guest , or place it on a serving table where guests will pour their own . Depending on the situation , you might set out a pitcher or a carafe of a beverage along with glasses or cups for guests to serve themselves .|What must be served clean?|glass or cups|1

My mom wanted my younger brothers to go to a certain middle school . That is why she moved . They moved to a rental house that was in the right zone . I was there some of the time . It was interesting to have five people in a small space even though I know many families do that regularly . They bought a house that was pretty close to the rental one , which is funny because the other house was about the same distance away . It was n't as big enough for the dog .

My mom wanted my younger brothers to go to a certain middle school . That is why she moved . They moved to a rental house that was in the right zone . I was there some of the time . It was interesting to have five people in a small space even though I know many families do that regularly . They bought a house that was pretty close to the rental one , which is funny because the other house was about the same distance away . It was n't as big enough for the dog .

This morning I got in my car to go to my job . I looked at my car 's dashboard . I looked at the fuel gauge . The red dial was near E which means empty . I drove to the nearest gas station and pulled up to the gas pump . My gas tank is on the right side of the car so I made sure that it was near the pump . I swiped my credit card and selected Regular gas . I lifted the nozzle and carefully inserted it into my tank . I squeezed the valve and waited for the tank to fill . I pressed - YES - to receive a receipt of my purchase . I keep records of my car 's gas use with my maintenance records . This helps me to know how well my car is working .|What did they need?|The driver needed gas for the car|1

Just recently , my entire family was home for the weekend . This is normally not the case , as either one or both of my parents have to go to work . Because of this , I wanted to make breakfast for them so that they could eat when they got out of bed . I got out everything I needed , and heated up the griddle that I would use to cook everything . I started with the pancakes . I mixed the batter according to the box that it came from , and made enough for the family on the griddle . I laid down an entire package 's worth of bacon on the griddle and cooked it until most of the fat was cooked off . Lastly , the eggs . I scrambled the eggs myself with a fork , and made some for everyone but myself , since I do n't like eggs . When my family woke up , they immediately came to the kitchen and saw that I made them all breakfast .|What meat did they decide to cook?|Eggs|0

My friends wanted something fun to do , so I decided to have a barbecue . I went to the store and picked out a bunch of steaks , hot dogs and chicken . I also bought buns , condiments and some paper plates . My friends came over one by one , and soon enough , everyone was there . We put the meat on , and everyone started commenting on how good it smelled . While everything was cooking , I put paper plates and silverware on a table next to the barbecue . Once the meat was done , I put it to the side and let everyone make their own dish . Everyone talked about how good everything tasted , and a few people even complimented my cooking skills . Once everyone was full , we cleaned up and everyone went home for the night .|What was brought home?|steaks, hot dogs, chicken.|1

I recently needed to find a new flat , so I started by familiarizing myself with websites that have local rental listings . Before searching these sites , I thought about what I could afford and what amenities I wanted . I considered the number of bedrooms and I decided on two so that I would have a home office as well as someplace for guests to stay when they visit from out of town . I did n't want to spend too much money on monthly rent , so I decided that I would n't mind living on the second floor and that I could go without a dishwasher . It seemed like everything near the city was too expensive . I began to be concerned when I had n't found a suitable place to live after a few weeks of looking . Persistence paid off when I found a two bedroom apartment that was a short drive to the city . Since it was not yet rented , I set up a time to look at the place and I ended up loving it . So , I signed the lease , paid a security deposit , the first month of rent , and moved into the flat .|They inquired about what?|two bedroom apartments|1

After living in my apartment for 7 years , I decided it was time to move . Prior to moving , I had to secure a rental truck so I could be assured that I could move my furniture to my new apartment . On moving , my son and I got up early and got the rental truck .  We devised a system where he would stay in the truck and I would bring out all the small furniture items and he would stack them . When we finished that task , we moved on to the larger items . These items took both of us to load onto the truck .  My son is over six feet and I 'm really short , so we had a lot of trouble getting the mattress out of the door and onto the truck ! We finished moving all the furniture in record time , returned the truck and sat down for some cold lemonade .|What was the mattress in terms of moving?|tiny item|0

I just woke up in the morning and I had a feeling there was something waiting for me in the mailbox . I got from bed and I put a shirt on . I walked outside and opened my box and my feeling was right . I opened the envelope which was addressed to me just to see a check note . I brought it out in a hurry and read through . It was the much anticipated payment from my uncle . I rushed inside and pick my phone to call my uncle that I have got the check he sent to me . But unfortunate his number was not available at that moment . Well , I knew it will go through soon , so I can just sit down and enjoy some fruit now .|When did they see a envelope?|when the writer woke up|0

A button fell off of my husbands shorts and I needed to sew it back on . I first got the button and pair of shorts that needed to be fixed . I found my sewing kit which includes , scissors , thread , and needles . Once I found the color I pulled enough thread to sew the button off of the spool and pulled the thread through the needle eye . I made sure the thread was even on both sides of the needle before beginning . Once that was done I put the needle through the button hole and tied it off to start . Once I made enough passes through the button I tied it off again making sure the thread does n't come loose . I then cute the thread . The button was then perfectly sewn on !|what was the thread matched to?|the scissors|0

My friend who I had n't seen in a real long time called me out of the blue and asked me if I wanted to go to a pub later that evening . I told him that I thought that would be really fun , so I agreed . So we went to one of the local places that I had been to on many occasions . We got there and it was really busy because it was on a Friday night . The bartender asked us both what we wanted and I ordered a beer and my friend did the same . He had another 30 minutes later , but I was still working on mine . Then the bartender asked if we wanted another , but I said that I was driving so I declined . We shook hands and both left .|When was the bar crowded?|Friday night|1

We arrived at the tennis courts before the match was scheduled to a start . We walked from the car to the court and gave our tickets to the gate attendant . He stamped our tickets and pointed us in the genral direction of our seats . My husband sat next to me and we waited for the match to begin . Once the match began , we watched carefully , but were careful to be quiet during play.We only got up from our seats when the ball was not in play in order to be respectful to those around us and not to distract from the match . We applauded each point scored by both platers as is customary and considered polite spectator behavior . Once the match was over , we left the tennis court and walked back to our car for the journey home .|When did she place the purse under her chair?|before she arrived at the tennis court|0

We decided we wanted to add wallpaper to a room . First we had to decide what pattern we wanted to go with our décor . After we decided on the pattern we left to go to the wallpaper store . A salesperson came over to help us make our selection . We found what we wanted , bought the necessary supplies to hang the paper and went home to begin papering the room . We started by measuring the walls , then we setup all the materials we needed to get started . We unrolled the paper , put the paste on the backside of the paper and began to put it on the walls . The ending result looked fabulous ! It was a lot of work but we were able to get it done by ourselves .|After several hours papering what was finally done?|The wallpapering.|1

Earlier today I walked out to my mailbox to get the mail . I always like to check the mail , because sometimes you can get fun things in the mail . When I opened the mailbox , I noticed several envelopes . One of the envelopes was addressed to me . It was a letter from my grandma ! I always enjoy getting letters from my grandma . She lives very far away , so writing letters is one of the ways she stays in touch . My grandma wrote to ask how I was and tell us about her visit to the beach a few weeks ago . I liked reading about her adventures at the beach . In the letter , she wrote about how she found seashells in the sand . Reading a letter from my grandma is a nice way to know what she is doing , even though I can not always see her . Now it is my turn to write a letter to my grandma so she can receive one in the mail too !|When did they open the envelope?|before seeing it was addressed to them|0

She lives very far away , so writing letters is one of the ways she stays in touch . My grandma wrote to ask how I was and tell us about her visit to the beach a few weeks ago . I liked reading about her adventures at the beach . In the letter , she wrote about how she found seashells in the sand . Reading a letter from my grandma is a nice way to know what she is doing , even though I can not always see her . Now it is my turn to write a letter to my grandma so she can receive one in the mail too !|What did they pull out?|Magazines|0
My wife and I decided that our home was getting way too small for our growing family , so we started looking online for a new place . We searched several rental websites before finally deciding on a few that we would like to go look at . We called the number on the website and spoke with a representative who agreed to help us . We wanted 4 bedrooms , a fire place , 3 bathrooms and a few walk in closets . So she found something and agreed to meet us there and what time . We arrived at the rental office and met her . We sat at her desk and looked over a few floor plans and talked about the cost of rent and several rules . She gave us a tour of the whole thing and we looked really closely at it because we felt sure this was the one we wanted . We went back to her office and filled out lots of paperwork . Then she gave us the keys to our new place !|Who did they follow to the one they wanted?|A real estate agent.|1

Making any kind of big change can be rough , but I just turned 18 and wanted to move out of my parent 's house . I looked online and through ads until I found an affordable flat that I wanted to look at . After setting up an appointment , I went to visit the flat and liked the inside of the home a lot . Then , I asked a few of my buddies to help me move in the following weekend . We brought all of my packed boxes into the new flat and started setting up my new place . Eventually , I forgot about how sad I felt about moving my parents , and really enjoyed being on my own . Moving into my new flat is one of the best experiences of my life .|When did they have their own place and space?|When in high school|0

After a day or two , the hair gets dirty . It gets harder to comb and needs to be washed . To do so , most people jump in the shower or bath and wet their hair first . Then they take shampoo and put a little bit in the hand , then rub it all over their hair . Then they wait a few seconds or a few minutes and rub the scalp as well to make sure they get rid of dandruff - some kind of dead skin . So they put another dose of shampoo in the hand and wash their hair again . Shampoo can not go in the eyes because it might burn . After the shampoo is on the head , and it has been rubbed in to clean the scalp , the most important thing is to rinse it with lots of clear warm water . The easiest way is to rub it with a dry towel , but some people like to use a hairdryer . Once the hair is dry , it can be combed any way the person likes , but it is important to avoid putting styling gels and other chemical on it too often to keep it healthy .|What is important to do?|to put in styling gels.|0

This summer is quickly approaching and I do n't really have any clothes , so I decided to go to the mall . This one store , Sears had a sign for a big sale , so I checked there first . After asking a clerk where the women 's clothing department was , I found a rack of clothes with half off shorts ! I was so happy and tried 5 pairs on . Next , I went to find some shirts to match . I tried on many shirts , because they 're all different brands , and ended up finding 4 tank tops that fit nicely . I went to the checkout counter and bought all of the clothes that i 'd found.The nice employee gave me an additional discount since I am a loyal customer . I left the store happy with my experience and eager to tell my friends about it and show them my new clothes !|Why did they put the shorts in their cart?|to leave in the store|0

After asking a clerk where the women 's clothing department was , I found a rack of clothes with half off shorts ! I was so happy and tried 5 pairs on . Next , I went to find some shirts to match . I tried on many shirts , because they 're all different brands , and ended up finding 4 tank tops that fit nicely . I went to the checkout counter and bought all of the clothes that i 'd found.The nice employee gave me an additional discount since I am a loyal customer . I left the store happy with my experience and eager to tell my friends about it and show them my new clothes !|When did they put the shorts in the cart.|after trying them on|1
My friend had gone to the market and bought all these annual plants for my garden for my birthday . It was such a surprise but now I need to get them in the ground before they wilt and die . I begin gathering my tools . I need to have my hose set up so once they are in the ground , I can water them . I also need a bag of bark . I begin by placing each plant where I think I want it . I want to be sure it looks good in that area and after checking the tag to be sure they will be in the best area for kind of sunlight they need to grow , I 'm ready to get started digging . I dig a hole several inches deeper and wider than the pot , pull the plant out of the pot and place in the hole . Then grab the hose to water and cover with bark . The plants should grow nicely in their new home .|When did they fill the hole?|After digging it|1

I live on a large property of apartments that has several nice activities for it 's residents to enjoy . One of my favorite activities is tennis ! I own 3 different rackets , all different colors , and like to experiment with each one . My neighbor Bill , who enjoys tennis as much as me , usually meets me on Tuesday afternoons for a few quick matches . We start by warming up before we get into playing with each other . The ball goes back and forth until someone misses a shot , or the ball goes out of bounds . The person who served gets the points and the person returning gets the ball to serve if they win . Bill has been playing for about 10 years longer than me , so he usually ends up winning .|How long does it take to serve the ball to the other person?|A few minutes|0

Yesterday , I looked out the window and saw my mail delivery person driving down my street . The mail truck stopped at my mailbox and put some envelops in my mailbox . Excitedly , I went to my mailbox to retrieve my mail . The letter was address to Granny Hunt followed by my street address . I checked the return address in the upper left hand corner and realized the letter was from my granddaughter , Emily , who is eight years old . I opened the letter . I ca n't wait to come to your house on Sunday . We went swimming yesterday . I wish you had been there . See you soon . Love Emily . I folded the letter and put it back in the envelop so I could keep it in a safe place .|What was inside the envelope?|a letter|1

Recently , I have been growing vegetables in my backyard . I grow several types of vegetables . I make sure they get enough sunlight and water each day . It is very rewarding to grow and consume my own vegetables . They taste very good . I think more people should try growing vegetables . I have had plants die in the past but I learn from my mistakes and use that information moving forward . I think I should add to my garden and grow even more vegetables . I think I would like to try to use vegetables and fruits that I have grown one day instead of purchasing them from the store . Hopefully one day everyone will be able to grow whatever they want .|What were they happy about?|Growing vegetables.|1

Last week my friend and I went to the public swimming pool nearby where we live . It was a beautiful day outside - a sunny 80 degrees with not a cloud in sight . When we arrived we found an empty spot and put our towels down , along with the items we brought for the day which included some snacks , suntan lotion , books , drinks , and a change of clothes .  There were many people there , including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends .  It was just the right temperature . Cool , but not too cold . We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while .  We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks .  I then took out my book and began to read while my friend relaxed with her eyes closed for a while .  After a few hours of swimming and relaxing in the sun , it was starting to get late so we decided to head home . We put some warm clothes on in the changing room and headed home for the day .|What did they do at the pool?|Swim|1

There were many people there , including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends .  It was just the right temperature . Cool , but not too cold . We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while .  We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks .  I then took out my book and began to read while my friend relaxed with her eyes closed for a while .  After a few hours of swimming and relaxing in the sun , it was starting to get late so we decided to head home . We put some warm clothes on in the changing room and headed home for the day .|What happened at the location?|reading and swimming|1

I bought a new car , well , new to me , last Summer and could n't wait to drive it home from the car dealer . I placed the key that the salesman had given me into the ignition and turned it to the right until the engine roared to life . I adjusted the seat so I was comfortable and could see the speedometer and the cars in front of me , and adjusted the mirrors so they were aimed at the road behind me . I placed my right foot on the brake pedal , shifted the car into reverse , looked in each of my mirrors and glanced over both my shoulders to make sure no other cars were coming up behind me before I gradually lifted my foot from the brake pedal . I placed my right foot back on the brake and shifted into drive before moving my foot from the brake pedal to the gas pedal . When I had moved the car forward to the parking lot exit , I placed my right foot on the brake carefully so as not to jerk to a stop at the intersection and turned on my left turn signal . I looked to my left , to my right , then to my left again before lightly pushing on the gas pedal to pull out into traffic and head home . I decided to take the scenic route home so I could have fun driving my `` new '' car home .|When did they look in the mirrors?|when driving|1

It was going to rain , and I did not want to deal with dog in rain , so I decided to walk a dog before it starts to rain . I grabbed an umbrella if by chance it start to rain early . I put the leash on dog and made its collar secure on his neck . I grabbed the leash in my hand and talked to dog , that I am walking him . So he seemed very happy and start to wave his tail . I got out and cross the road to walk him towards park . When I was walking him , he saw other dogs and start to bark . I made a gesture to him to stop . After a while i decided to sit on bench , which was in dog park . I kept holding a leash and loosened it more for him to be fee for a while to go far distance , so he can mingle with other dogs . After few minutes I decided to go back home , as clouds were getting more darker .|Why did they put on tennis shoes and a trench coat?|to walk the dog|1

Almost every afternoon , my family and I like to get exercise while also walking our dog . When we first started walking our puppy , he did n't really understand what was going on . It seemed like some days we spent more time almost dragging him instead of him walking along by himself . Eventually though he learned that when we grabbed the leash that we store by the front door , that it was time to explore the neighborhood together . We attach the leash to him to ensure that he does n't get run off and get into trouble . After we attach the leash , we head outside and begin walking along the sidewalks in our neighborhood .

In addition to a leash , we make sure to bring little baggies with us in case he needs to go to the restroom . If he goes to the restroom in someone else 's yard , we make sure that we pick it up and bring it home to throw it in the trash as we want to be a good neighbor .

Almost every afternoon , my family and I like to get exercise while also walking our dog . When we first started walking our puppy , he did n't really understand what was going on . It seemed like some days we spent more time almost dragging him instead of him walking along by himself . Eventually though he learned that when we grabbed the leash that we store by the front door , that it was time to explore the neighborhood together . We attach the leash to him to ensure that he does n't get run off and get into trouble . After we attach the leash , we head outside and begin walking along the sidewalks in our neighborhood .

Last night , I took a bath . I take baths when I have time to relax and soak in bubbles . Baths are important for good hygiene and self esteem . I like to fill the tub up as full as I can and pick a shower gel or bubble bath to make lots and lots of bubbles . I just soak in the bubbles and enjoy the time to myself . Then I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner . After that , I am ready to dry off and get into some clean clothes . If I do n't have time for a bath , I just take a shower . Showers are much faster !|When are they clean?|after tub is full|0

On my way to work this morning , I decided I wanted to listen to some music . First I turned on the radio to see what was playing . I flipped through several different radio stations , including the hop hop , rock , pop and country stations . None of the stations were playing any songs that I really wanted to hear at that moment , so instead I decided to use an app on my phone and play a playlist that I had previously saved . I decided to play a playlist filled with classic rock songs that I loved . My commute to work is an hour long , so I was able to listen to many of my favorite songs , such as \ \ Bohemian Rhapsody \ \ by Queen and \ \ I Love Rock & Roll ' by Joan Jett . Soon , I finally arrived at my place of work . I unplugged my phone from the auxilary port , got out of the car , and walked into work for the day .|Where did the writer plug in their phone?|into the car radio|1

On my way to work this morning , I decided I wanted to listen to some music . First I turned on the radio to see what was playing . I flipped through several different radio stations , including the hop hop , rock , pop and country stations . None of the stations were playing any songs that I really wanted to hear at that moment , so instead I decided to use an app on my phone and play a playlist that I had previously saved . I decided to play a playlist filled with classic rock songs that I loved .

I went out to buy the nicest suit I could afford at Boscov 's . It was n't much , but I was able to purchase matching shoes , a tie , and socks . This was all in preparation for my job interview . I was ready . Around noon , I left for my one o'clock appointment with the supervisor of TechUnited , a computer consulting company . The interviewer asked me some tough questions , but I had my answers ready . I went home , and nervously laid in bed for a nap until I fell asleep . A week went by , and I had n't heard anything . One evening though , I received a call asking when I would like to start .|What did they get?|another interview|0

I like to walk my dog in the morning before it gets too hot out . On a regular morning I will drink my coffee and feed the dog . The dog always knows when it is morning that I will be feeding him and then we will be going for a walk after so he gets very excited and begins running around in circles . After we are both done with our morning routine , I grab the dog 's leash and put it on the dog . His tail wags very fast because he loves going for a walk . The dog and I start off slow in order to warm our muscles up . We walk by Mr. Johnson 's house with all the flowers and straight down the street to the corner where there is a small empty lot . He loves to sniff all the plants and rabbit holes . Then we come home . The dog loves his daily walk .|When can the dog sniff at everything?|On their morning walk.|1

I woke up early on Monday because my mother was coming over for dinner and the place was a mess ! I knew I had to straighten up or she would be disappointed in me . I started by picking up all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture . I threw them in a hamper and carried them down the hall to the laundry room where I started them in the washer . I loaded them into the dishwasher and pressed a button to make it start . I looked around the living room . Still a mess ! I pulled a trash bag out of the cabinet and collected all the paper , junk mail , and old food cartons and soda bottles that I had left out . When my dog barked , I remembered that I should vacuum as well to get rid of the fur all over the carpet . My dog did n't like the vacuum ! When I was done with that , I took the trash to the outside can and came back inside . The flat was clean !|When did they plan to take the trash outside?|before vacuuming|0

Today is bathroom cleaning day , said mom as she walked in from work that Friday afternoon . Us kids were hanging out in the living room , one on the computer , another watching TV , another on their phone and I was finishing my school project . We all knew what she meant by bathroom cleaning ; that meant we all were going to have clean the whole house staring with the bathrooms . My siblings give me the stink eye , when I walk upstairs to my chore assignment . That 's why I am the oldest I whispered to them as I grabbed the cleaning products and smirked when they were salty about it . Because they got stuck with the rest of the house . I headed to the bathroom upstairs and sprayed the tub with the tub cleaner , and I let that soak . I sprayed the toilet with the toilet cleaner and let that soak and sprayed the sink with the disinfectant and let that soak . After a few minutes I rinse the tub down and the product did all the work for me , the shower looked good as new . I scrubbed the toilet with the toilet scrubber and it was clean in no time . I wiped down all the surfaces with disinfectant , cleaned the mirrors , took out the trash and sprayed the bathroom with disinfectant . After twenty minutes , I was finished . So I headed to the kitchen for a snack , as the rest of my siblings were still cleaning away .|What gets cleaned on cleaning day?|the bathroom only|0

Last night I decided I was going to go dancing . My husband , daughter , sisters and their husbands and nieces went out to a nice place where a lot of people go . We got to the place we were going dancing . There was a guy at the door checking ID 's to make sure there was n't anyone under the age of 21 going in . We all went in and found us a table . We then decided to order some drinks and about that time a waitress came over and asked us what we would like to have . We all gave her our order and she went to get the drinks . We all went out on the dance floor and danced until the end of the song . We went back to our table and our drinks arrived as soon as we got back . We all drank our drink and decided to dance some more . We stayed for a few hours and danced . We all went to the door . We told one another bye and we all left and went home .|Who was over the age of 21?|no one in the group|0

I was going to the park today with my kids and thought it would be great to take some outdoor pictures with my camera . I went to the cabinet and got my camera and pressed the power button . The camera did not start and I realized I needed new batteries . My drawer in the kitchen holds all our batteries , so I found two AA batteries to put in the camera . I slid it off and proceeded to install the two batteries . There is a positive and negative side to each battery so you have to make sure you put them in the right slots . After I put the batteries in , a slid the lid back on . I turned the camera on , to make sure it worked and it did . I took a couple of pictures inside the house to make sure it worked and then we left to go to the park .|When did they find the lid of the battery compartment?|After leaving for the park.|0

I was on vacation in Spain , where I explored several cities and saw lots of new things . Of course , I brought my camera along to document the trip . After a long day of visiting a very famous cathedral , my camera 's batteries were dying . I opened the battery compartment of the camera and tilted it so that the batteries would fall into my hand . I took care to keep the new ones and old ones from getting mixed up . I handed the dead batteries to my wife so she could throw them out . The battery compartment closed with a snap , and I was ready to take more pictures ! We went out that evening for dinner and a flamenco dancing show , and I was ready with my powered-up camera .|What was aligned properly?|the new batteries|1

I took care to keep the new ones and old ones from getting mixed up . I handed the dead batteries to my wife so she could throw them out . The battery compartment closed with a snap , and I was ready to take more pictures ! We went out that evening for dinner and a flamenco dancing show , and I was ready with my powered-up camera .|How long did they aligned them?|in seconds|1

I have grown vegetable ever since I was a little boy . So a green thumb was not acquired naturally , as some neighbors liked to believe . I was pretty good with growing my plants from a seed . No transplants here . I found an amazing growing method for my vegetables . I always start them off in egg cartons . I buy some potting soil , then I put the soil into the egg carton and and plant the seeds . During the day , I leave the lid open on the egg carton . And at night , I close the lid and it keeps them safe and warm . I have grown everything from sunflowers to watermelons with this method . Once the seeds grow into 1 inch plants . I transport them into the ground . There they will grow on their own and produce lovely vegetables .|What grows fast for them?|trees|0

When my wife and I moved into our new place , we had to prepare in advance several days . We had to pack up several things in large and small boxes . The we had to call some of our friends and ask if they were free the following weekend to help us move . Then we had to arrange to pick up a rental truck . So when moving day finally arrived , we were all ready . One of my friends drove me to the truck rental place and we picked that up and arrived at our place . I backed up the truck in the drive way and opened the large door in the back of the truck . We started with all the boxes first , then the furniture . We emptied all the furniture from the truck and moved it into the new place . Then we did the boxes . Then we started trying to figure out where everything was going to go . Then we ordered pizza for everyone and had a good time just hanging out and resting from a hard day 's work .|Where did someone arrive?|at their place|1

First , my friends and I got together and decided what game to play . We set up a table with enough chairs around it for everyone to sit comfortably and I pulled the game from the cabinet . We unpacked the board and all the pieces needed to play the game onto the table .  Each person decided what pawn they would use to play . We looked at the instructions and read them out so everyone would know how to play , and those of us who had played before answered questions from those who had n't . We rolled dice to determine who would play first and from there , each person took turns moving around the board and trying their hardest to win .  We talked and laughed as we played and everyone had a lot of fun . In the end , I won the game .|When was there a lot of strategy in play?|During the game.|1

Today starts the day i prepare for my entrance exam into colleges . After a wide time of preparing and hard work i was ready to suceed . I get to the exam center 30 minutes before it starts . I make sure i have everything i need including number two pencils a calculator and a lot of scratch paper for all my mistakes for the math part . I ask to excuse myself and use the bathroom for a very quick moment . I calm myself down before i enter the room . When i finally got the chance to look at the exam a huge sign of relief finally came about me . I confidently took my pencil and began the exam with a smile .|when did the sweat begin|After taking exam|0

I had spilled some soda on my bed , so I had to change my sheets before I went to bed . First I took off my blanket , which was still clean . I set it to the side . I took the old sheets off , removed the pillow cases from my pillows , and tossed them into a pile on the floor of my bedroom before going to the hallway closet and taking out a fresh , clean set of sheets . I unfolded the fitted sheet first and started in one corner of the mattress , getting that corner in place before stretching the sheet slowly to slip over the next corner , then the next , and then the fourth and final corner . I tucked the bottom end in under the mattress , making sure that I still had enough on the bed to use at night . Then I slipped clean pillowcases onto my pillows . I pulled the top sheet tight and straightened it out over the bed before setting the blanket on top . I was done !|What did they unfold|Pillow cases|0

Today was a really hot day . It was 95 degrees . I decided to go to the swimming pool in my neighborhood and cool off . I put on my bathing suit , a cover up dress , a hat with a large brim , sunglasses , and flip flops . Then I walked three blocks to the swimming pool . It was crowded , but I was able to find an available lounge chair on the side of the pool . I put my things down and took the sunscreen out of the bag . Then I laid down on the chair to relax . After about twenty minutes , I was ready to go in the water and go swimming . I swam five laps and then I was ready to get out . It was a nice day .|What was packed in the bag with sunscreen and a cold bottle of water?|a towel|1

My mother was an amazing seamstress . She was able to sew the most beautiful clothes and taught me the basics when I was a teenager . That teaching came in handy when I was teaching music in the inner city and needed to sew costumes for the musical . I started by getting a length of fabric from Hancock Fabrics . Next I used a pattern and pinned it to the fabric , so I could accurately cut the fabric before I sewed the pieces together . Next , I cut the pieces into the correct sizes . I pinned the two pieces of cut fabric together and threaded the sewing machine with a matching color thread . I sewed the side seams of the fabric together on each side while the fabric was inside out . Next , I folded the fabric inward a half inch around the waist and pinned it . The final step was folding the fabric a half an inch up at the bottom of the skirt for the hem and sewing it as well . The end result was a cute western skirt that several of my students needed for the musical .|What was the costume piece needed to sew?|a cute western skirt|1

I received a call from another company telling me I needed to fax over my invoice to them ( the bill ) as soon as possible . I found the invoice on my computer and sent it to the printer . Once it printed , I wrote my name on it and the other person 's name on it who would be needing the invoice . I pressed the fax button and punched in the phone number of the other person 's fax number so they would receive the paper on their end . After putting in the phone number , I pressed send . The machine made a dialing sound so I knew it was starting to send . Once it dialed , it made a ' buzzing ' noise which I knew meant that the paper was transmitting the data ( copying and sending to the other person ) .|What was delivered successfully?|fax|1

I wanted to buy a birthday cake . A bakery had recently opened near my house so I thought about buying my cake there . However , I realized my work hours might be different from the bakery 's . Their hours were not listed . But their phone number was . I called them to learn their hours of operation . When my workday ended , I left quickly for the bakery . After arriving , I waited behind seven other people who had arrived after their workdays as well . We all had orders to place . The bakery employees were patient with us ; some of the orders were filled right there with cakes that were already baked . It was a good thing I called them earlier .|When did they place their order just after the bakery's closing time?|after arriving at the bakery|0

When I was young , my mom had an obsession with painting the walls of our house . As soon as she finished painting one room , she would start on another . We were in this never ending flux of wall colors . Instead of using a roller and painting the walls a solid color , she would dab a rag in the pan of paint and repeatedly press it against the wall , creating a unique textured look . The problem was , her bedroom was huge , so this took months and enlisted the help of me and my siblings . The first time I tried it , I did all of the dabs in a really uniform way , so each looked like the other . This was not how she had painted the rest of the wall , and so my section stood out and looked very different from the rest . She did n't paint over it or anything , so for the remainder of the time that we spent in that house , that section of wall looked completely wrong and out of place .|what was painted in an unconventional way?|The wall|1

I am a teacher and I needed to present a PowerPoint to my students . Before class , I got the technical cart with the audio/visual equipment on board and rolled it into my classroom . I turned on the projector to make sure the light was working and I placed the projector where it would shine on my while board . I also plugged in the audio cable . I opened the PowerPoint and clicked play to check if everything worked . First , I turned the focus knob so my PowerPoint came into focus . It looked too small , so I moved the cart farther away from the white board and refocused the projector until I was satisfied with the image . They were turned off , so I turned them on and adjusted the volume . I played the PowerPoint all the way through to make sure it worked . It did , and and my students saw the presentation .|What did they check after hearing no sound?|Speaker|1

I walked up to the trashcan in my room and looked inside , it was fairly full which meant I needed to change it and put in a new one . I grabbed the bag from the two sides and pulled it out . Next I scrunched up the top and tied it into a knot to keep the garbage inside from falling out . After taking it outside and putting it down on the curb for the garbage men to come and pick it up tomorrow , I went back inside and into the kitchen . I went back to my room and pulled the bag apart so the sides were no longer sticking against each other . I aired it out and then stepped in front of my trash can .

Today my carpet in the living room was looking a little dirty , so I decided to vacuum it . I went to my closet where I store all of my cleaning supplies , and took out my vacuum . I wheeled it to my living room and unwrapped the electrical cord that was attached to the vacuum . I then turned on a switch on the side of the vacuum and the vacuum turned on , making a loud noise ! Using my arms , I moved the vacuum back and forth across the dirty carpet . I made sure to clean every single area on my carpet . I unplugged the cord and wrapped it back around my vacuum . I wheeled it back to my cleaning closet and put it away in it 's rightful place .|Where did they plug in the cord?|in the plug on the wall|1

In the summer , we love to build a bonfire and sit around and visit . Sometimes we even roast marshmallows or hot dogs in our bonfire . To begin , we choose a safe location to build the fire where we will not catch anything else on fire . As a safety precaution , we also bring a water hose and a few buckets of water so that if the fire was to begin to spread , we could quickly stop it from getting out of control . After we have our wood and water , we also look for some leaves or something else that will easily catch fire such as newspaper . We then use this to light the fire with a very long lighter because we want to continue being safe . Once the flames have almost subsided , we roast marshmallows or hot dogs .|What do they pile in a safe location?|wood, leaves, newspaper|1

I love seeing colorful birds and fun insects visit my home during the warmer months . Since we had no flowers to attract wildlife , I decided to plant some . First , I went to the supermarket and bought some fertilizer and potting soil , then I picked out a few potted plants and some packets of seeds . Next , I dug smaller holes to gently place the seeds into . When all of the plants were situated , I filled up my watering can and generously watered all of the plants and seeds . Each day , when I wake up I water them so they can grow big and strong . Then all of the birds and wildlife can enjoy them and have food to eat for the summer .|What will grow into plants?|wildlife|0

Next , I dug smaller holes to gently place the seeds into . When all of the plants were situated , I filled up my watering can and generously watered all of the plants and seeds . Each day , when I wake up I water them so they can grow big and strong . Then all of the birds and wildlife can enjoy them and have food to eat for the summer .|Where were the plants placed?|In the holes|1

I was doing some remodeling in my house and decided it was time to put some new wallpaper up in one of the bedrooms . The first thing I had to do was pull the old wallpaper off of the walls . I put newspaper down on the ground in the bedroom so that there would n't be a big mess anywhere , and began pulling . I was able to pull the wallpaper off in very large sheets , except for a few spots where the paper was very sticky and stuck to the wall . I used a solution to get the remaining glue off of the walls , and waited for everything to dry so I could come back the next day and put the new wallpaper up . The next day , my boyfriend and I worked together to peel the back off of our new paper to expose the adhesive , and we carefully pasted it on the walls in the bedroom . We used a tool to flatten out any air bubbles that we saw . We were satisfied with our work when we were done .|Where was wallpaper applied?|in their remodeled house|0

On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool . There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there . Before we go , we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops . We make sure to pack snacks , and towels and drinks into a bag , and grab a float and a ball to play with . Once there , we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool . The water feels so cold at first , but its so refreshing . We swim around and realize we have friends there . We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more . Going to the swimming pool on hot days is the best way to stay cool and have fun too .|What was the weather like?|hot summer day|1

Last Saturday , I went to the toy store to buy a birthday present for my niece , Samantha . After I drove to the toy store , I parked in the parking lot and got out of my car . I walked into the toy store and grabbed a shopping cart . My budget was $ 30 , so I ignored any dolls that were over my budget . Finally I found a doll that I knew she would like . I put it into my shopping cart and pushed the cart to the cash register area . When it was my turn in line , I put the doll on the belt and the cashier rung it up for me . She told me that the total was $ 24.99 . I took my wallet out of my purse and got out two 20-dollar bills . Then she gave me my change , which I put into my wallet so it would n't get lost . I put my wallet back into my purse while the cashier put the doll into a plastic bag and handed it to me . I pushed the shopping cart and the bag out of the store , but I left the shopping cart in a corral for an employee to take back into the store . I was happy to have that birthday shopping done !|Samantha really liked dolls, so they walked over where and began browsing?|the internet|0

Last Saturday , I went to the toy store to buy a birthday present for my niece , Samantha . After I drove to the toy store , I parked in the parking lot and got out of my car . I walked into the toy store and grabbed a shopping cart . My budget was $ 30 , so I ignored any dolls that were over my budget . Finally I found a doll that I knew she would like . I put it into my shopping cart and pushed the cart to the cash register area . When it was my turn in line , I put the doll on the belt and the cashier rung it up for me . She told me that the total was $ 24.99 . I took my wallet out of my purse and got out two 20-dollar bills . Then she gave me my change , which I put into my wallet so it would n't get lost . I put my wallet back into my purse while the cashier put the doll into a plastic bag and handed it to me . I pushed the shopping cart and the bag out of the store , but I left the shopping cart in a corral for an employee to take back into the store .

I arrived at the salon and walked inside . At the front counter was a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment . I did have an appointment that I scheduled for that day . She let me know that my hairdresser would be ready for me in a few minutes , so I sat down in the lobby and read a magazine for a few minutes . I found a picture of a short hairstyle that I really liked . When my hairdresser came to the lobby to get me , I showed her the picture of the haircut that I wanted . I followed her back to the salon area , and she motioned for me to take a seat in a big chair . I sat down , and she put a cape around my shoulders to prevent hair from sticking to my clothes . She brought over a cart with a small tub on it , and told me to lean my neck back while she washed my hair . After shampooing my hair , she rinsed it out with water and put it up in a towel to let it dry . She rolled the cart away and came back with a comb and pair of scissors , and combed through my hair . Long pieces of my hair fell all around me to the floor . She turned my chair around so she could reach the hair in the front of my head , and when she was done she washed her scissors off . Then , she dried my hair with a blow dryer and my haircut was fully revealed . She took the cape off of me and we chatted for a bit about our days and I thanked her .

When preparing to cook vegetables , I like to first find only the freshest vegetables to prepare . The last time I cooked a meal , I went to the kitchen and slowly got out everything I need first and then began to cut the vegetables on the cutting board . The process was slow , but relaxing . Everything was evenly cut and when baked , was delicious . When I chopped up the onions , I felt my eyes start to water , but as I cut everything , I felt that my meal was getting better and better . After cutting everything and making my meal , I cleaned the cutting board and started to throw away and scraps . I enjoyed this experience and had a great time doing it . This was my best way to cut vegetables .|What did they use in the meal from scratch?|meat|0

When I was younger , I really wanted to go see some dinosaurs at the museum . I asked my dad if he would take me and eventually he said yes . We got in his car and we drove a couple hours to go visit the dinosaur museum together . I remember him opening the door and the first thing I saw was a giant T-Rex standing right above me ! I gasped when I saw it and my dad laughed at how excited I was . We went up to the counter and he paid . We walked through the museum and listened to the talking TV 's that told us about each of the dinosaurs . It was really fun to do with my dad .|when did they walk a couple of minutes to the entrance of the museum?|after their dad paid for the visit|0

My wife and I have been jogging for fitness since we met in 1998 . We were usually jogging on pedestrian footpaths and sidewalks , but this year we were going to try a state park . We were n't so sure about jogging around places with a lot of people and dogs but got a state park pass and went to the a large park near our home city . We packed water bottles and sunscreen and headed out . We watched all the cars and people pile into the parking lot the same time we were and got ready for our jog . We spotted a path that looked perfect with some rolling hills on it according to the sign at the trail . We wished we had thought of going to the parks before . But now we have plenty of fresh new places to visit to do our jogging .|what did the people start doing?|bathing|0

My new dog was very bad at listening . She needed to be trained because she did not listen to any commands and could not be controlled . I decided to bring her to a dog trainer so that I could get some help in training her to be a well behaved dog . I immediately called and reserved a spot in the next class so I could start learning the training techniques . The following day at 4 pm I arrived at the class with my dog . Once we arrived at class the trainer started working with my dog . The trainer was able to teach my dog to sit on command , and to lay down when told to . By the end of the class I was able to get my dog to perform these tricks on my own .|What could they train?|any dog|0

Last month , my family and I went on the best vacation ever : Disney World . It all started with driving to the airport and getting on a plane . The plane ride was long and cramped , but it was worth it once we arrived at our hotel , which was right next to the Disney World park . It was hard for me to sleep that night , but when the next morning came , we all ate a yummy hotel breakfast and then headed into the park . They were really nice and even took pictures with me . We also went on a lot of fun roller coasters . None of them had any loops , so I was n't scared of them . On the plane ride home I was really sad that we had to leave .|When did time go by too fast?|While enjoying Disney World|1

It was hard for me to sleep that night , but when the next morning came , we all ate a yummy hotel breakfast and then headed into the park . They were really nice and even took pictures with me . We also went on a lot of fun roller coasters . None of them had any loops , so I was n't scared of them . On the plane ride home I was really sad that we had to leave .|When did it go by way too fast?|in the hotel|0

I was going on a vacation for a week , so I had to make sure all of the windows and doors to my house were locked . I first locked the back door . I turned the doorknob lock and bolt lock . Next I did the windows . I entered each bedroom and turned all of the locks on the windows . The bathroom does n't have a window so I did n't need to go in there . I passed the bathroom and entered the kitchen . The attic has no windows so next I went to the den . The den only has glass patio doors , so I latched shut the patio doors . I made sure the garage door was shut and locked it . After I double checked all of the locking I did , I exited the front door and used my house key to lock it behind me before I went to catch my plane .|Where were the windows?|in the plane|0

Today I decided to go for a drive . I got my keys and unlocked my car . I got inside the car and sat down .  I then put the keys in the ignition switch and cranked the car . I put the car in reverse and looked in my rear view mirror to see if it was clear to back out of my driveway . I saw that it was clear , so I began to back out of my driveway carefully while positioning my hands on the steering wheel in the ten and two positions .  Once I was out on the road , I carefully put my breaks on and put the car in drive . After I put the car in drive , I gently pressed the gas and began driving down the road .|When did they put on their seat belt?|during driving|0

Yesterday I went to a sauna with my friend . It was a Korean spa that is very popular . We checked in at the desk and confirmed our reservation .  We were given robes and slippers to change in .  The robes were very comfortable and cozy . We then relaxed at the spa and went into the hot tub . It was very refreshing .  Afterwards , we checked out the masseuse to get a foot massage .  We ended up falling asleep at the sauna and taking a quick nap . When we woke up , we were hungry so we got a bite to eat at their indoor Korean restaurant . We bought some Korean short ribs , rice , and some beef cubes .  We really enjoyed ourselves and plan to return go back again soon .|Where did they change?|sauna room|0

Earlier today I decided that I would like to have a hot dog for lunch . The first thing I did was check the kitchen to make sure that I had hot dogs , buns , ketchup , and chips . When I was ready to cook lunch , I took my indoor grill out from the cabinet , plugged it in , and waited for it to heat up . While I waited for the grill to heat up , I set my plate with a bun , a handful of chips , and 2 pickles . When the hot dog was halfway done cooking , I opened the lid and turned the hot dog around , so all sides would be equally browned . After the hot dog had finished cooking , I removed it from the grill and put it on my bun . Before eating my hot dog , I unplugged my grill , and wiped it down with a wet cloth . After I finished that , I was ready to eat my hot dog . I squeezed a small amount of ketchup on top of my hot dog and took my plate to the porch to eat . W I was finished eating , I brought my empty plate inside and rinsed it off .|What did they eat with the ho t  dog and chips?|Two pickles|1

When the hot dog was halfway done cooking , I opened the lid and turned the hot dog around , so all sides would be equally browned . After the hot dog had finished cooking , I removed it from the grill and put it on my bun . Before eating my hot dog , I unplugged my grill , and wiped it down with a wet cloth . After I finished that , I was ready to eat my hot dog . I squeezed a small amount of ketchup on top of my hot dog and took my plate to the porch to eat . W I was finished eating , I brought my empty plate inside and rinsed it off .|When did they eat their hot dog, chips, and pickles?|When the hot dogs were cooking|0
Earlier today I decided that I would like to have a hot dog for lunch . The first thing I did was check the kitchen to make sure that I had hot dogs , buns , ketchup , and chips .

I just got back from a vacation spending a week at the beach with my son . It was so nice to get away for a while . What is not nice is the amount of laundry I now have to do !  I dumped out all of our dirty clothes . I sorted into 3 piles - the towels and thick items that do n't have any wash restrictions . The second pile was my clothes , which many need to be hung up , but I like to use a strong smelling detergent .  The third pile consisted of all of my son 's clothes , as well as any delicate items , such as bathing suits that will be washed in a free and clear detergent , as my son has skin allergies .  When it was done , I put the clothes in the dryer or hung those that can not dry . I added a dryer sheet and started the process over with the next batch . It take time , but sorting it out is the best way to tackle the task .|Where did they put one load of laundry?|Bath Tub|0

I woke up one morning and my throat was so sore I could barely even swallow . I just knew I had to try and get into the doctor 's office . I thought I might have strep throat ! I signed in and gave the receptionist my insurance card . She registered me and told me to go wait in the waiting room . I sat down and read an old Better Homes and Gardens magazine . First , she weighed me and measured my height . Then , we went into an exam room . She asked me a few questions and took my temperature and blood pressure . After a few minutes , the doctor came in and looked at my throat . He was certain I had strep throat .

As I begin my day I walk past the computer and turn it on.I go on to the restroom and when I come back I log onto the internet . Instead of standing and waiting I walk over to put some bread in the toaster for my breakfast . I walk back to the computer and type in youtube.com .  My toast is up .  I go over and put some butter and honey on it and get a bottle of water out of the refrigerator to drink .  Now I need to think of a song I want to play . Sometimes it is very hard to decide . For now I type in the youtube search bar , " I need thee every hour " and click on the " enter " button .  What a way to start my day .|How long before the song starts?|in less then a minute|1

I wanted to take my girlfriend out for a nice dinner for her birthday . She is very picky about food and has excellent taste so first I had to pick a restaurant I knew she might like . I also wanted to pick a restaurant she had never been to before . I looked up their phone number on the internet and found it on their website . Then I called the restaurant and told them I 'd like to make a reservation for two on August 6th . They told me what times were available . I chose 7:30 because I wanted to go out for putt putt afterward and this would give us plenty of time to do that . I knew my girlfriend would be happy .|Who confirmed the time and place of the reservation?|The boy friend|1

Last summer , I went to India . We had won tickets for a tennis match . We arrived at sunset and the stadium was fully packed . The chairs had stickers reading , \ \ Volleys can be hard to control if there 's a lot of spin on the ball . \ \ The foot-rests had stickers written , \ \ The word deuce was used in real tennis for hundreds of years before the modern game developed . \ \ Shortly after the national anthem , the game began . Serena played a perfect drop shot that just got over the net and landed about one foot from it . The game was a double . Normally , in a game of doubles , the outer line down each side of the court acts as the boundary Julio tried to hit her serve too hard and it missed the court and was a fault . Severally , the line judge said the ball was in , but the umpire overruled him and called it out .|Who was playing tennis against Julio?|Venus|0

I always did my taxes pretty simply . But once I did the state separate from the federal . I sent in something to the state . But they called me . So I sent in something else . I had tried to do it online . But they said they got the form , but that it was blank . I have done it online since then with no problems . Maybe it was something wrong with on their end or I just did n't know what I was doing . Overall , doing them was really simple . So far I have done everything on my own that I can . You avoid fees that way . I might be able to do it more manually with the federal .|What did they send in the mail?|a card|0

When I worked at a tuxedo shop in high school i found myself sewing clothes all the time . We rented out tuxes that we would fit people for but sometimes they would come in and the pants would need to be a bit longer or a bit shorter . Most of the time it was because they would wear the tuxedo pants higher than the sweats or jeans they wore when they came in to be measured . Because of this I would find myself letting out the ends of pant hems or making them shorts and using a sewing machine to fix them . Because these were rentals though , we would use a temporary hem so that we could take it out and re hem them after the fact so the next person could have them set to their size .|When did they sew clothes?|All the time.|1

I decided that I wanted to rent a movie instead of seeing something in a movie theater . Because there are n't any video stores around anymore , I checked on my tv to see what was available for me to rent on cable . I also checked to see if there are any Red Boxes in the area where I can rent a DVD for $ 1.20 . I drove to the grocery store down the street and found the Red Box . I used the Red Box to look through the available movies . I sorted the movies by what came out most recently . I finally found one I thought sounded interesting . I selected Hidden Figures because I had not seen it yet . After I made my choice , I used my debit card to pay the $ 1.20 fee , added my email address to get my receipt , and finished the transaction .|What was rented by someone else?|a video game|0

When I woke up this morning the first thing I saw was how many dirty clothes were lying all over the floor of my room . I told myself in my head that I needed to wash these clothes as soon as possible because my room looked like a tornado came through it . I gathered all the dirty clothes around my room and my bathroom into my dirty clothes hamper laundry bag . I use this bag because I live upstairs and I do n't like having to back track across my home if I drop any clothes when I bring them to the washing machine which is located downstairs . I start by throwing all the clothes into the washing machine followed by using whatever laundry detergent I have at the time . Today I still had some liquid detergent left over from the last load of laundry I did so I carefully measured half a cup of detergent into the measuring cup and dumped it over the dirty clothes . I closed the washing machine and turned the dial on the machine to run for 45 minutes .|What did they have in the bag?|dirty clothes|1

I use this bag because I live upstairs and I do n't like having to back track across my home if I drop any clothes when I bring them to the washing machine which is located downstairs . I start by throwing all the clothes into the washing machine followed by using whatever laundry detergent I have at the time . Today I still had some liquid detergent left over from the last load of laundry I did so I carefully measured half a cup of detergent into the measuring cup and dumped it over the dirty clothes . I closed the washing machine and turned the dial on the machine to run for 45 minutes .|Where did they have all their dirty clothes?|drawer|0

One day I was hungry and checked my refrigerator for something to eat . I found a plate of mixed meat and vegetables and decided to heat it in my microwave . The plate was microwave safe , so I did n't need to move it to another container . After checking that the microwave was clean inside , I put the plate in the microwave and placed a plastic microwave cover over it . I then set the timer for automatic heat . This way I did n't need to figure out how long it would take . The microwave did it for me . After about a minute or so the microwave made a dinging sound letting me know that my food was ready . Steam rose showing that the food was very hot . I was careful when I started to eat so I would n't burn my mouth .|What was being removed?|The microwave from the kitchen.|0

Swimming is very hard , so yesterday I took a swimming class . The swimming class was taught by a life guard and swim instructor . The first lesson was to learn how to float and blow bubbles in the water .  I had a lot of fun with these steps , so I easily advanced to the next level ! The next level was practicing with a swim board , and kicking my legs . Once I got the hang of this part , I advanced to trying to swim forward just laying on my front in the water , I was able to learn this part pretty quickly as well .  The only form I can swim for now is free style , but I think I can do more soon !|What do they want to learn?|how to use a swim board|0

Every now and then , the batteries in my camera die . Today , when I went to take a picture the camera would not turn on so I knew that the batteries must be dead . This is always the first sign that clues me into this problem . So , first thing I did is went to see if I had the right kind of battery for the camera . I carefully removed the piece of the camera that closes the battery compartment . It pops open when I slide it back , so this was fairly simple . I then removed the old battery and disposed of it . I popped in the new battery , being careful to line it up correctly so that it was entered the correct way . I had to line up the plus signs and the minus signs , but it was easy because the camera has guidelines inside it that instruct me .|When was their camera ready to go again?|the camera was always good to go|0

This is always the first sign that clues me into this problem . So , first thing I did is went to see if I had the right kind of battery for the camera . I carefully removed the piece of the camera that closes the battery compartment . It pops open when I slide it back , so this was fairly simple . I then removed the old battery and disposed of it .

One of my teeth was hurting me , so I knew I needed to go see a dentist . Since I had just moved into town , I looked in the phone book and found the names of the local dentists . I then did some searches on the Internet and read the reviews on each dentists . I called to make an appointment , telling the receptionist that I was currently in pain . The receptionist offered to let me come to the office that day if I was willing to wait for the dentist to fit me in between his existing appointments . I said that I would be willing to do so , and inquired about the cost of a visit and the cost of x-rays and receiving a filling , as I had not yet switched my insurance to my new state . Finding the prices acceptable , I gave the receptionist my name and told her to expect me in about an hour . She asked me to have a seat and she would tell the dentist . I was pleasantly surprised to not have to wait very long . A dental assistant took some x-rays , and before long the dentist came in and told me I had a cavity that needed to be filled . The procedure went quickly and painlessly . I thanked her and returned home .|What was chosen by the person?|receptionist|0

Today I decided to water my indoor plants because the soil in their pots was dry . I first got my watering can from next to the sink . Then , I filled it with water from the sink and added a drop of plant food from the plant food bottle . I used the watering can to pour water at the base of the plant 's stem . When water came out of the bottom of the pot , I moved on to the next plant . As I watered each plant , I checked to make sure that it still looked healthy . When I was done watering all of the plants , I poured the remaining water in the watering can down the sink and placed the watering can back in its place .|How many times did they refill the watering can?|twice|0

I was riding my new bicycle when I stumbled over a rock or something . The tire seemed to explode upon impact . I struggled to stay atop the bicycle but was fortunately able to keep my balance .  I knew the local gas station was only a few blocks away so I decided to walk my bike there . The first thing I did was get something to tape up the hole . The manager gave me some sort of sticky resin in order to patch things up .  I went to the air pump to put some air into the tire and once it was full I was ready to patch it up .  I rode the bike home and made sure to avoid rolling over anymore rocks .|They used the resin to cover what?|A hole in a shoe|0

On Tuesdays I am normally the last person to leave the house . My mom and dad leave for work an hour before I have to leave for school . Because of this , it 's very important that I lock the house up after I leave . Once I have all of my things , I check the back door to make sure that it is locked . Sometimes my dog uses a doggy door on the back door . Mom normally wants me to block this off too , so I make sure that is secure . Finally , making absolutely sure I have the house key i need , I make sure that the house security system is armed . I 'm ready for my day knowing that the house is safe and secure .|how long did it take to lock the front door|5 minutes|0

I got asked out on a date by a boy I have a college class with , and I said yes . I was very nervous but also excited . Before I left for the date , I made sure to give myself enough time to get ready . I picked out a dress to wear with a jean jacket on top . I left my house to meet my date at the restaurant he had suggested . It was a nice restaurant in the middle of the city in Minneapolis . I sat down by him and began making conversation . We had a nice conversation throughout our entire meal . He was nice , funny , intelligent , and very goal oriented . At the end of the date , we split the bill and he walked me to my car . He gave me a hug and asked if I 'd like to go on another date . I said that yes , I would , and that I would call him later that week .|Where was he sitting?|in car|0

Yesterday it was Sunday . We had guests at our house . I had to prepare dinner for them . So I woke up early in the morning . Then I decided what dish I am going to prepare . Then I checked the list to make sure I have all the ingredients . I took out the pen from the closet . I put the pen on the stove . Then I add some oil in pen and added ingredients of the dish I was preparing . I stirred all the ingredients thoroughly . After the food item was prepared I transfer it from the pen to dinner vessel . I put dinner mats on table . Everything seemed prepared for dinner , and I was then just waiting for guests to arrive .|What did someone arrange?|guests|0

Oh the horror of having to visit relatives . I remember when I was a kid how traumatic the whole experience was . We always lived far away , a couple of states , away from the extended family . So going to visit relatives was n't just packing up and going across town . We packed up , sometimes even got on airplane . When we went to visit relatives , we would stay for a couple of days or a week . Then there was the drive , usually lasted two days and a night spent in a motel -LRB- which was my favorite part of the whole thing . -RRB- Usually the first person we would visit would be my grandmother , my mother 's mother . She was a bit uptight but man , could she cook . After a couple of days , we 'd always drive over and visit an aunt or a cousin , or sometimes both . Then there was the drive home . Again , staying in the motel overnight was always my favorite part .|How long were they there?|a couple of days or a week|1

We had decided to stay in to prepare something simple for dinner tonight . We had plenty of pasta and spaghetti sauce in the pantry , so this was an obvious choice . We started with the angel hair pasta , since we had several packages of this variety . Following the short cooking time , we set the pasta aside to drain . Since we had wanted to spice things up a little beyond the standard pasta dish , we decided that we would add in the pine tree nuts that we had purchased at the local farmers market earlier in the year . I had this very dish at an Italian restaurant one time , and was impressed with the added flavors that the pine nuts had produced .|What was in the pot?|the pasta.|1

Friday afternoon is our traditional grocery day . Through the week we find ourselves running to the store for something quick we may have run out of , but the full on grocery shopping day was always Friday afternoon . I work from home Fridays and it is usually a slow day , so my wife goes grocery shopping in the early afternoon and comes home . I help her bring everything in , we put it on the kitchen counters and go through putting everything in the proper places in the kitchen or around the house . It is a bit of a process because some of the things she gets goes upstairs in bathrooms and bed rooms some might go int he basement for storage or extra things like toilet paper for when the stock upstairs runs out ... but most of it is centered around food that goes in the kitchen .|Where does the food go to?|the grocery store|0

My sister , Rachel , and I were planning to make surprise dinner reservations at a nice restaurant for my parent 's 30th wedding anniversary . I got online and looked at the different restaurants in the area , and selected a nice Italian restaurant in the city . I found the number on their webpage , and called the number that was listed . When the person on the other end answered , I explained that I was trying to make dinner reservations approximately 30 days in the future . The person who answered , a man , asked me how big of a party did I need to be accommodate . The surprise dinner was for my parents , and my sister , older brother and I all planned to attend . The man then asked me what time would I be arriving at the restaurant . I told the man that we would like to come in and eat around 6 o'clock . He then confirmed the date and time with me one last time , and asked me for my phone number and first and last name . After confirming the date and giving the man my information , he thanked me for my reservation and wished me a good day . I then hung up the phone .|What did they need to do?|Plan a surprise party|0

Last month I was driving to work , on a path I take every day , when a police officer pulled up behind me with lights blaring ! He stopped me and said " M'am you were going 30 mph over the speed limit and I 'm giving you a ticket ! " As I drive this route every day I know the speed limit and I am 100 % confident his radar was malfunctioning as I could not have been going that fast . Instead of paying the fine on the ticket I decided to go to a court hearing in order to fight against the ticket . I am very nervous so I woke up extra early to get ready , making sure to wear a simple and clean outfit . I mentally prepared what I was going to say to the judge in my head and practiced it over and over on the drive there . The only thing left to do now is enter the court hearing and speak with the judge regarding my case .|What is today for them?|Their drive to court|0

It was late on a Sunday evening when I noticed that my cellphone 's battery was running low . I plugged in the charging cord but the charging icon showed the cord was not working . I really wanted to be able to charge my phone that night . So I wanted to check if any store that would have a charging cord would be open on a Sunday evening . I was able to ask my phone assistant for a list of electonic stores near me . When the list appeared I looked for the nearest store . The store was listed as closed and would n't open until 8 in the morning . Looking over the list of stores again I noticed one that I was thought might be open 24 hours . I called the telephone number listed to make sure they were open and ask if they had charging cords in stock . They were open and had the cords . I went out the door and drove right over . No more charging problems - for a while .|When did they check for stores and their hours?|the  next morning|0

We were really excited about going to Disney World , but we also wanted to discover the world 's best sea shells , which were a few hours away on Sanibel Island . Since my wife and I lived in New York , we knew that driving there would be difficult , so we decided to fly . Making a reservation is always difficult since you get severely penalized for changing or canceling your plans , so we were careful to make sure our work and families would be okay with our plans before booking . One morning , a price alert came through indicating that the price dropped and that we could save a lot of money if we acted quickly . We logged onto the Web site and confirmed our purchase before those unpredictable machines could change their minds and raise the prices again .

We were really excited about going to Disney World , but we also wanted to discover the world 's best sea shells , which were a few hours away on Sanibel Island . Since my wife and I lived in New York , we knew that driving there would be difficult , so we decided to fly .

I was working at a school as a Spanish teacher . For summer courses they opened a 6 week course of French . So they hired a French lady to be the teacher for that course . That same day they told her she had been accepted as teacher and her course would start in 2 weeks . So , as she was new in the school and her English was not that good , she needed help to install and set up her presentation equipment , since she uses a lot of images and videos to support her teaching . So we went to the auditorium and I unpacked her equipment : a computer , an image projector , a big screen and a speaker . I had to locate the " source " button to switch among the different inputs to locate the computer input . Then I plugged in the speaker using a cable to connect the headphones output from the computer to the speakers and it went perfect . Just leveled the volume , and she was ready for her first class .|What was being projected?|a lot of images and videos|1

At work today my boss asked me to make her a copy of a report for the meeting at ten am . I took her papers and went into the copy room to make copies . First I turned the copy machine on .  This machine makes copying easy so I did n't have to copy everything by hand . All I had to do was take out the staple holding the report together and insert the stack of papers into the opening of the machine . The copier copied the whole stack and spit out the new copy of the report and even stapled it together too .  I picked up the original report and stapled that back together .  I turned off the copy machine .|When did they hand over the copy they made?|before meeting|1

I was shopping this past weekend and picked up a new painting that I thought would look great in my living room . When I got home I had to figure out exactly what to move around since my walls are pretty full . I figured out a new way to move pictures around until I had a nice empty spot above my couch . I measured the distance between the two hooks on the back of the painting and put small marks on the wall the correct distance apart . I used a level to make sure the second nail was level with the first . When I got it perfectly level I pounded the other nail in the wall . I lifted up the painting and lined up the hooks with the nails and slid the painting onto the nails . The painting looks great above my couch !|What did they pound with the hammer?|Nails to hold the painting.|1

I was so excited for my trip to the beach . I would be there for five days so I wanted to make sure I packed everything I needed . I decided to take my large suitcase and a smaller travel bag . First I put in a pair of pants . Beside my pants , I put in three pairs of shorts . I added two casual dresses on top of the pants . On top of that layer I added two bathing suits and a cover up . I put my underclothes on the top layer along with a pair of pajamas . In the front section of my suitcase I put in two pairs of sandals , a pair of flip flops and a pair of tennis shoes . I put my toiletries into the smaller bag - shampoo , conditioner , toothpaste , toothbrush , makeup and deodorant . I realized I had forgotten beach towels so I got a large tote bag that I could also carry to the beach and put two towels in there along with a bottle of sunscreen . Now I was all ready for my beach trip !|When did all that fit into the suitcase?|after the packing was complete|1

I put my underclothes on the top layer along with a pair of pajamas . In the front section of my suitcase I put in two pairs of sandals , a pair of flip flops and a pair of tennis shoes . I put my toiletries into the smaller bag - shampoo , conditioner , toothpaste , toothbrush , makeup and deodorant . I realized I had forgotten beach towels so I got a large tote bag that I could also carry to the beach and put two towels in there along with a bottle of sunscreen . Now I was all ready for my beach trip !|Where did they put the clothes?|in the large suitcase|1

I enjoy playing games with my father and my brother . At a young age , my father began collecting and play many different types of games and consoles . This has carried on throughout his life until my brother and I were born , after which he passed on his hobby to us . Before we were old enough to have our own games , my father would allow us to play his games or play cooperative games with us . Halo is a multiplayer shooter game in which we teamed up and destroyed aliens . The franchise has many different titles and we have followed them throughout my childhood , much like my father did when he was young . Another game that we all enjoy is Call of Duty . Earlier in the series , there was no way to play multiplayer with the three of us equally , so we would take turns playing , giving up control of the game when the other lost .|What kind of game is Halo?|A multiplayer shooter game.|1

Last night , my friends and I sat around my dining room table to play Monopoly , which is our favorite board game . I played the banker , so I took the instruction booklet to double check out how much money I needed to give each player . I gave each of my friends the amount of money designated in the booklet , then I set the rest of the money aside for when we started the game . I picked the Dog . Then we designed that the order of the players would be youngest to oldest , so I went first . I rolled the dice , and the dice landed on " 6 . " I landed on a railroad space , and decided to buy it . I took the money for the railroad from my personal pile and gave it to the bank pile . Then I took the Railroad property card and put it in front of me . I did n't win , but I did come in second place .|what did they pick|The dog.|1

The best way to start the day is by cooking up some scrambled eggs . Every morning , the first thing I do is open up the fridge and make sure I have some eggs and milk . As soon as I make sure I have my ingredients , I go to the cupboard and take out the frying pan and mixing bowl . Once I have the mixing bowl I smile instantly knowing it is now time to crack the eggs into the bowl and mix them up with a little bit of milk . The sizzling of the eggs as they cook is heaven to my ears . What I usually do is let them cook on one side for a couple of minutes then I will break the eggs up with a fork and let them finish cooking for a couple more minutes . Ding ding ! The timer is going off and it is now time to put the eggs on my plate and let them cool down before I chow down !|Where does the writer pour the mixture?|In the frying pan|1

Last month , I visited my relatives in Florida . I have an aunt and uncle there , as well as cousins . I had n't seen them in years and usually only see them at family functions . As a result , I first bought plane tickets and planned my luggage and times , called out of work for the days that I vacationed , planned a rental car , and then went there . I had a great time and was able to see many family members that I had n't seen in years . It was an enjoyable experience and not only did I get to see family that I do not get to see often , but I also got to swim and experience the lovely hot weather of Florida . I had to fly home a week later though unfortunately .|What was so much fun?|The trip to Florida|1

I was going for a long drive , so I knew my car would need more fuel than it already had . I pulled into the station and checked the dash to be sure I knew what side the tank was on before I parked next to one of the pumps . I pulled the lever inside to open the panel for the gas cap and hopped out of my car . I slid the nozzle into the fuel tank and started to pump . I watched the gauge carefully to be sure I knew how much I was getting , and how much money I was spending . When I had a full tank , the pump stopped all on its own ! I put the nozzle back in the holster on the side of the , screwed the gas cap back in place , and closed the panel . I was ready for my trip !|What did they pay for at the pump?|gas|1

I was going for a long drive , so I knew my car would need more fuel than it already had . I pulled into the station and checked the dash to be sure I knew what side the tank was on before I parked next to one of the pumps . I pulled the lever inside to open the panel for the gas cap and hopped out of my car . I slid the nozzle into the fuel tank and started to pump .

I 'd had my old bike sitting around the house for a few months , but now that the weather is getting warmer I decided I should probably do something about the flat tire in the front . I 'd already tried using my bike pump ; it would inflate a little but I could never get it anywhere close to fully inflated . I know from past experience those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are pretty worthless . I have a mountain bike with large tires and a lot of pressure is needed to keep them inflated . Since I only live a few blocks from a bicycle repair shop I decided to take the bike there . I bought it at that shop anyway so I figured they 'd do the service for free , as promised . I stopped by , they took it in the back , replaced the inner tube of the tire , inflated it , and it was as good as new . That 's the beauty of local , independently own businesses . They really care about their customers .|Where would they see the narrow old tires?|At the bicycle repair shop.|1

On Friday , my son , John , really wanted to go to the playground . It was at the end of his first week of first grade , and he really wanted to unwind . I decided it would do him some good to get out and play with some kids , so we got into the car . The playground was about a 5 minute drive from the house , and we spent that time listening to our favorite songs on the radio . I was amazed at all the other cars there ! As soon as I unbuckled John 's seat belt , he bolted through his open door and headed towards the park . I could hear the laughter and chatter of children as I approached , careful to keep my son within eyesight the entire time . I stood on the side with the only parents while John played with some kids and burned off some energy .|Where had they arrived before parking the car?|the school|0
