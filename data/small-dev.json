We waiting until opening day, and went down that night to buy our tickets to watch the show.  We waited in line for several minutes before we were able to pay for our tickets.  Once we had our tickets we got in line to buy some snacks.  I ordered a large popcorn with extra butter and a large Coke.  Steve ordered a medium popcorn with butter, some peanut M&Ms and a large Dr. Pepper.  Once we had our snacks we handed over our tickets to the usher and walked into the theater.  We carefully scouted for just the right seats.  When we found the perfect seats, we sat down and watched the movie previews to see what new movies would soon be coming out.  Once the previews were over, the theater darkened and the movie began."

I also put the bacon in the frying pan and flipped each piece after several minutes. Once the bacon was cooked, I poured the veggies and egg mixture into the pan, stirring occasionally, until the mixture set up and was solid. Once cooked, I removed the eggs and placed them on a plate along with the bacon. I put the plate on the table and poured out a glass of orange juice to go with my meal. I also peeled an orange and set it on the plate. It was delicious!"

I walk into the store and the way it is laid out I can easily find the items that I need pretty quickly , grocery shopping is not my favorite past time , I go to the deli counter and get lunch meat for help yourself nights and school lunches . I then head to the meat department to get some chicken and a roast for Sunday . Now time for the isles and my coupon matches , I head down each isle relativity quickly since I already know pretty much what I am going to buy and how much of it I need . I finish each isle and have all of my necessities . I go over to the bakery to see what they have on sale today and see a large carrot roll with cream cheese filling . So I place that in my cart and head for the checkout isle . I place all my purchases on the belt near the cashier and watch as each one is scanned , She totals my purchase and I pay for them . As I leave the store I look at my watch and realize it took me much less time as usual . Now I can enjoy the rest of my day ! "

In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved."
