Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove. On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan, and put that pan on the stove. She turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough. When she ate it, she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made."

Remembering that I had a library card somewhere in my desk at home , I went home and found it . I went to the library and after browsing the fiction section , I finally found the fifth book in the series and brought it to the check out desk of the library . I handed over my information and library card and checked out the book , getting two weeks to read it for free . I 'm now a quarter of the way through the book and enjoy every page of it while loving the fact that my taxes paid for me to read this and I had to pay no extra money . "

I knew I had to change the batteries. This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work. I grabbed the clock, turned it upside down and located the slot for the batteries. I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required: two AA-sized batteries. These are quite common, and I got them from the kitchen drawer. I removed the old batteries by lifting them up, then I placed the new batteries in the same position, making sure the plus-side of the batteries (the little tip) were in the right direction, as it is usually engraved on the plastic. I closed the lid carefully, and the clock started ticking again. I adjusted the time with the help of my watch, and went to bed, knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning."

I went into a room first to change clothes. I didn't want any of the clothes I was wearing to get wet and steamy, so I brought a swimsuit to change into. The steam works best when it touches your skin, so you want to wear a swimsuit or a towel. I moved into the sauna room and sat on a bench in the warm steam. It was very relaxing to be in there, like a hot bath. After a while, I left and changed back into my regular clothes. I felt much better and was not as nervous after visiting the sauna."

I waited in line with the other people wanting to go in, and when it was my turn I paid for my ticket and then went inside. There was so much to see! There was a room about different kinds of rocks and where they came from. Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals--dinosaurs, a sabretooth tiger, and even a mammoth! The plaques next to them told me all about when and where the animals lived. While I was at the museum, I moved from one room to the next and took my time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip. I spent all day learning about natural history, and there were still things I didn't get to see so I planned to return to the museum as soon as I could. It was a wonderful day!"

I grind the beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get it started. I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans. Meanwhile, I'll gather my ingredients from the fridge. I want eggs, butter, English Muffins, and Canadian bacon. A breakfast sandwich sounds good. I'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster. My water just finished boiling, so it's time to pour that in the Chemex over the ground beans. I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the pan. I grab and egg and scramble with a fork. My pan is heating and the butter is melting I put my egg in and swirl it to cover the bottom of the pan. While I wait for my eggs to set up, I'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon. Back to the eggs, they are almost set so I'll fold them into a half circle and flip. Grab my toasted English muffins on a plate. Layer my Canadian bacon and fold my freshly cooked eggs on top. I'll pour myself a cup of coffee and now I can sit down for breakfast. Looks good."

Take things into consideration such as how much sun it gets , what zone you are in , and how quickly you want it to grow . Dig a hole large enough for the tree and roots . Place the tree in the hole and then fill the hole back up with dirt . Many small trees will need support until they are bigger . This will ensure they grow tall and straight . It is crucial to keep the tree watered ! It will need a lot of water at first . Mulch is helpful to keep the soil moist . It 's also important to wait until the threat of a frost has passed or is not in the near future . Giving care to your new tree will ensure that it will grow big and strong ! "

I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them."

I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole.  I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time.  Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter, then plug it in. I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster. I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot. The timer counts down and I pay attention to it carefully, making sure the toast pops up and the toaster turns off.  I unplug it immediately but let it cool down before putting it away as it is very hot.  I butter the bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter."

One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window . I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that . "

I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly\u2019s name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister\u2019s address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck the stamp with the heart design on it in the upper right corner. Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week. I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly will be so surprised!"

I looked in the telephone book and found several pizza restaurants that would deliver.  We all talked it over and settled on a pizza from Domino's.  Then we discussed what we would like on our pizza and what size we should get.  I called the number and gave our order to the person who answered.  We ordered a large pepperoni and onion pizza with extra cheese.  He told me that our pizza would cost $15.00.  I said that would be fine and asked if the pizza could be delivered.  He said, \"yes\" and asked for my address.  I then gave him my name, address, and phone number.  He told me that our pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes.  When the delivery boy arrived, we paid for our pizza and included a $2.00 tip.  Then we enjoyed eating our pizza!"

I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home . "
