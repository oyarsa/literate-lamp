Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove. On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan, and put that pan on the stove. She turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough. When she ate it, she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made."

Remembering that I had a library card somewhere in my desk at home , I went home and found it . I went to the library and after browsing the fiction section , I finally found the fifth book in the series and brought it to the check out desk of the library . I handed over my information and library card and checked out the book , getting two weeks to read it for free . I 'm now a quarter of the way through the book and enjoy every page of it while loving the fact that my taxes paid for me to read this and I had to pay no extra money . "

I knew I had to change the batteries. This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work. I grabbed the clock, turned it upside down and located the slot for the batteries. I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required: two AA-sized batteries. These are quite common, and I got them from the kitchen drawer. I removed the old batteries by lifting them up, then I placed the new batteries in the same position, making sure the plus-side of the batteries (the little tip) were in the right direction, as it is usually engraved on the plastic. I closed the lid carefully, and the clock started ticking again. I adjusted the time with the help of my watch, and went to bed, knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning."

I went into a room first to change clothes. I didn't want any of the clothes I was wearing to get wet and steamy, so I brought a swimsuit to change into. The steam works best when it touches your skin, so you want to wear a swimsuit or a towel. I moved into the sauna room and sat on a bench in the warm steam. It was very relaxing to be in there, like a hot bath. After a while, I left and changed back into my regular clothes. I felt much better and was not as nervous after visiting the sauna."

I waited in line with the other people wanting to go in, and when it was my turn I paid for my ticket and then went inside. There was so much to see! There was a room about different kinds of rocks and where they came from. Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals--dinosaurs, a sabretooth tiger, and even a mammoth! The plaques next to them told me all about when and where the animals lived. While I was at the museum, I moved from one room to the next and took my time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip. I spent all day learning about natural history, and there were still things I didn't get to see so I planned to return to the museum as soon as I could. It was a wonderful day!"

I grind the beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get it started. I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans. Meanwhile, I'll gather my ingredients from the fridge. I want eggs, butter, English Muffins, and Canadian bacon. A breakfast sandwich sounds good. I'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster. My water just finished boiling, so it's time to pour that in the Chemex over the ground beans. I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the pan. I grab and egg and scramble with a fork. My pan is heating and the butter is melting I put my egg in and swirl it to cover the bottom of the pan. While I wait for my eggs to set up, I'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon. Back to the eggs, they are almost set so I'll fold them into a half circle and flip. Grab my toasted English muffins on a plate. Layer my Canadian bacon and fold my freshly cooked eggs on top. I'll pour myself a cup of coffee and now I can sit down for breakfast. Looks good."

Take things into consideration such as how much sun it gets , what zone you are in , and how quickly you want it to grow . Dig a hole large enough for the tree and roots . Place the tree in the hole and then fill the hole back up with dirt . Many small trees will need support until they are bigger . This will ensure they grow tall and straight . It is crucial to keep the tree watered ! It will need a lot of water at first . Mulch is helpful to keep the soil moist . It 's also important to wait until the threat of a frost has passed or is not in the near future . Giving care to your new tree will ensure that it will grow big and strong ! "

I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them."

I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole.  I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time.  Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter, then plug it in. I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster. I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot. The timer counts down and I pay attention to it carefully, making sure the toast pops up and the toaster turns off.  I unplug it immediately but let it cool down before putting it away as it is very hot.  I butter the bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter."

One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window . I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that . "

I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly\u2019s name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister\u2019s address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck the stamp with the heart design on it in the upper right corner. Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week. I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly will be so surprised!"

I looked in the telephone book and found several pizza restaurants that would deliver.  We all talked it over and settled on a pizza from Domino's.  Then we discussed what we would like on our pizza and what size we should get.  I called the number and gave our order to the person who answered.  We ordered a large pepperoni and onion pizza with extra cheese.  He told me that our pizza would cost $15.00.  I said that would be fine and asked if the pizza could be delivered.  He said, \"yes\" and asked for my address.  I then gave him my name, address, and phone number.  He told me that our pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes.  When the delivery boy arrived, we paid for our pizza and included a $2.00 tip.  Then we enjoyed eating our pizza!"

I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home . "

I placed camp chairs around our fire pit.  Then my husband placed the dry wood in a pyramid shape inside the fire pit.  He then set some small kindling ablaze using a long lighter.  Once the kindling reached the dry wood, it set the wood on fire.  We then sat around the fire for some time, adding more logs as the previous ones burned out.  We cooked marshmallows on sticks over the open flames.  When the marshmallows were golden brown, we placed them between two graham crackers with chocolate pieces.  We ate our S'mores as we joked, laughed and told stories around our beautiful fire.  When we finished, I put away our camp chairs.  My husband made sure the fire was out by dousing it with some water and we went inside to bed."

Usually when we are busy we stay in touch by texting but we like to hear each others voices so we often call each other.  My friends and brother like to use our cell phones.  I give them all a special ring tone so I know who it is right away when they call.  I take my phone out of my pocket and look at the face and see my brother or friends picture.  Then I swipe the green phone icon and hold it to my ear and say \"Hi There.\"  But sometimes I still use land lines, like when I am at work or my grandparents house.  Then I will hear the classic ring of an old phone, and I will have to go over to the phone to pick it up.  I take the receiver off the cradle its sitting on and hold it to my ear and say \"Hello.\"  The person on the other end will have to introduce themselves, because I wont know who has called.  But usually I am lucky and its someone I want to talk to, so its a fun surprise."

I used my broom to sweep up all the dust and dirt off the floors the hard floors, and the vacuum to clean up the floors that had rugs and carpets. When the hard floors were swept, I used a bucket with floor cleaner and water, and a mop, to mop them up. As the dried I took a rag and began dusting everything in the room. The t.v., the tables and counters and everything else that was a hard surface, I used the rag to dust. My flat looked very nice when it was clean."

I decided to go ahead and set the dining table before everyone arrived. I put the place mats in front of each chair at the table. I then placed dinner plates on each of the place mats. I folded my favorite napkins neatly and placed on beside each plate. I also made sure that everyone had a fork, knife and spoon. The last thing I put at each place were the glasses. I gave every person one glass for water and another glass for any other drink they might want. I had tea, soda and milk for the children. Before I placed all this on the table, I made sure to put my favorite red tablecloth on the table. Everyone sat to eat and we had a delicious dinner together."

Inside there is a brown and jelly mixture that doesn't smell too good to me. Felix has already smelled it and he is purring at my leg. I find Felix's bowl and turn the tin over until the food drops out into the bowl. I mash it up a little with a fork and then put the bowl down beside Felix. He starts to eat right away. He must have been hungry. I also give him a little bit of water because he needs to drink also."

The park is close by to our home, so we decided to walk there. It took less than 5 minutes to arrive. When we got there, my husband laid out the picnic blanket on the soft grass. We sat down, and I emptied the basket. We had a good time. We were talking and laughing while eating our food. We some birds and gave them some of the breading off the fried chicken. The birds loved it. It was fun, and we really enjoyed each other's company. It was a good break for us from everyday life. Afterwards, we packed our stuff and took a stroll around the park. It was beautiful sunny day. Then we headed home. At home, we said to each other that we should on dates more often."

Because we were going to have guests over, we wanted to make sure the bathroom was clean in case they needed to use it.  To clean the bathroom, we got out the cleaning supplies from the closet.  We got out glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, paper towels, and a scrubber.  We took turns washing the mirrors in the bathroom, organizing the counter, and then cleaning the toilet.  I was the one assigned to do that, of course.  I made sure that there wasn't any dirt or gross things on the toilet.  I poured the toilet bowl cleaner into the bowl and scrubbed it all over the toilet.  After I did that, I got the paper towels and made sure that I cleaned up all the wet stuff that was left over on the toilet and the seat."

The Barker family started saving up some money in a jar, and it started to accumulate. the higher the pile in the jar got, the more money they had to spend on their trip. Soon the family was ready to go! the season came around so quickly and they were already packing to leave town for the week. the Barkers ventured out into new and uncharted territory for them. They went to a place called: California. California was warm compared to where they lived in Alaska. they were so overjoyed to feel the heat on their faces. They took so many pictures and sent uncountable postcards. they got to their hotel and went to sleep, they had such a long plane ride. In the morning they traveled to Disney land and had so much fun! they went on rides and went to different parks. but they had already spent a week in California. so it was time to go home the Barkers booked a plane and got the plea tickets they packed up their luggage and checked out of the hotel. they got on the plane and traveled home. They got to Alaska and went home when they got to their door they all went to bed immediately."

I had never been to a sauna before but I had heard a lot of my friends talk about how much they loved it and how relaxing it was for them, so I figured I would give it a try. I got to the sauna and was greeted by a very calm and soothing employee who first directed me to a massage room. I waited and got a great massage which made me very relaxed and ready to go into the sauna. I entered the sauna and the first thing I noticed was that it smelled very woody, almost like being deep in a forest. It was also very hot inside but it wasn't unpleasant. I sat down in the corner and closed my eyes, trying to relax. I spent about thirty minutes in the sauna enjoying the heat and took a shower when I was finally ready to leave. Going to the sauna was the perfect relaxation I needed after my stressful week!"

They had me update my health insurance card and fill out some paper work.  Then it was a short wait before the nurse called my name.  She brought me to the back and got my weight and other information.  We talked a bit and she led me into the exam room.  It wasn't long before the doctor came in.  He checked me out and talked to me about my condition.  He gave me a prescription, but also told me to stay away from foods that made me hurt."

My friend reminded us that the wood had to be dry, or else it would not burn very well. Next, we all helped out by placing the chunks of wood into the fire pit. Once we stacked the wood into the fire pit, my friend grabbed a lighter and lighter fluid. My friend poured some of the lighter fluid out onto the wood, and then used the lighter to light the wood. It took a few tries, but the wood finally caught on fire, and we were able to start our bonfire. As the fire continued to burn, we added more wood or newspaper to keep the fire burning. We all had a fun time sitting around the fire and talking."

I picked American Airlines because I have most of my airline miles with them and I always like to earn more miles.  I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight.  The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights.  I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them.  I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card.  Once my flight was paid for I received an email confirming my transaction and providing me my flight details.  I find that using the internet is much easier than calling the airlines for a flight reservation."

We found our spot and unpacked the car. First up was pitching the tent, then we set about making a fire to cook dinner. It took awhile to collect all the wood we needed and get it roaring, but once we got the food on the fire we could finally relax. After soaking in nature and enjoying our campfire meal, night had fallen and it was time for bed. We curled up in our sleeping bags and told scary stories until we drifted off. The next morning we awoke early to stoke the fire and get breakfast started. A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars we packed up our gear and headed home."

We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water. We put on our bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us."

To prepare for the barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers, hotdogs, rolls, chips, salad and soda.  When I returned from the store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill.  As my friends began to arrive one of them volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball.  As the food was prepared we all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then we quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes.  After a few hours my friends decided that it was time to go home.  We really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer."

The shopping center is very large and modern looking. It was only built two years ago. It has three levels. I enter the centre and begin strolling through the main level. It is not very crowded today. There are escalators that you can take to reach other levels. There are many large windows, so it is almost like being outdoors. I can smell coffee and cinnamon buns from one vendor. A few birds are inside, and they fly around. There are pots with trees planted in them. From where I am standing, I can see exactly which stores I want to go into. I am confident that I can find the dress I want."

I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. From the carton, I took three eggs and inspected them for cracks. They looked fine, so I cracked them into a small bowl being careful to to have any shells in it. I added a splash of water and then began to scramble the eggs with a whisk. Next I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in it. Once the pan was hot, I poured my eggs in it. After adding a dash of salt and pepper, I kept scrambling the eggs. Occasionally i would remove the pan from heat while scrambling for a short moment. Once the eggs looks firm and ready, I turned off the stove and plated my eggs to enjoy. I added a small sprig of parsley to the plate to make it look even fancier."

Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs.  There is a low net between both people playing the game.  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball back and forth to each other.  Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores.  The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set.  We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired, then we came home.  It was really a good workout for the both of us and we would like to take you to watch and play the next time we decide to play tennis."

We took the shopping list and also wrote down where in the store we would find the food.  We organized it from the fruit to the dairy in an organized order.

When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like.  Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder.  I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me.  Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish.  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  I might put a few onions in with it.  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad.  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer.  While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes.  When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts.  It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through.  While I set the table, I let it cool and after a few minutes I serve my self a piece and my salad and side dishes."

Sometimes, I would get bored when my siblings would swim, so I brought the book The Lord of the Rings with me to read if I was bored.  We made it to the pool and they stamped our hands when we arrived.  I went to sit down by the grass hill until it was my turn for a lesson.  While I sat there, I read a book. Then it was my turn to get in, so I put my book down and got into the water.  The teacher taught me and then I got out of the pool."

It is one of his favorite meals to eat and also to help prepare. He asked if he could help with preparing dinner. First, we got an oven pan and lined it with Aluminum foil. We opened a can of croissants and unrolled them. He cut each pastry triangle in half, so that each would be small and we could have more. He placed a slice of ham on the croissant piece and sprinkled it with shredded cheddar cheese. We began rolling up each piece from the long side, all the way until there was a croissant piece, ham and cheese rolled up. We placed them on the baking sheet and put them in the oven. In 15 minutes, they were golden brown and baked with love from my baby!"

I brought some balls to hit and he gave me a racquet to play with.  We started on opposite sides of the court and practiced hitting the balls over the net.  We did a really good job and decided to start playing.  We kept score by whoever made two bounces on the opposite team's court.  I did really well and I won over 40 points.  That meant that I had one the game.  But there were many games in a set, so we kept playing until I came out as the winner in the end of it all."

Once I confirmed that our space was reserved for our trip, I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases. I packed pillows, bed sheets, pillows, food, medicine, toiletries, shoes, and anything else that I felt we needed to have with us while we were away. Additionally, I ensure that we had bug  repellent spray, hats and jackets to protect ourselves while out in the wild. We also brought pots, pans, gallons of water, eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat- even if we did not have a stove or oven. Once everything was packed, the luggage was all packed into the back of the truck, I also had to gather the camping tent, foldable chairs and sleeping bags for our trip, and load them into the truck as well. The last thing I needed to pack was some canned and nonperishable foods that could be cooked, along with things such as bread, snacks, soda and juice. Now that we have covered everything from sleeping arrangements, clothing and food, and it was all packed in the truck and ready to go, the only thing left to do now was get in the truck and drive off on our way to our reservation."

The wedding was about to start so we quickly found some seats near other friends of ours.  An organ began to play, which let us know that the ceremony was starting.  Members of the wedding party arrived in a procession.  The bride was the last to arrive at the altar.  A minister performed the ceremony.  The bride and groom exchanged vows and also exchanged rings.  When the ceremony finished, the couple kissed, and everyone applauded.  Then the bride and groom and their bridesmaids and groomsmen marched back out of the church.  Afterwards, they took many pictures before the reception."

After getting permission from the city, we began to plan the night. First we went to a local man and bought all of the necessary bonfire wood, which is much bigger than the logs that would go into a fireplace. We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire. We bought burgers, hot dogs, and buns for each. We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses. We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores. We arrived at the beach just before sunset and built the bonfire with the very long logs. Once we felt like they were all in place, we lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for our guests once they arrived."

I picked out a recent release and brought the empty box up to the counter. There the attendant took the film cover and went to find the corresponding film. They brought back the film in a clear cover and told me I had three days for the rental. I paid for it next. Then I went home and watched the film. It was enjoyable and I was pleased with my selection.The next day I returned it to the store. I did not want to forget to return it because there are late fees for late movie returns."

I called my sisters and friends and we all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep us safe. We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later. Alone, I looked at the ladies shoes. I bought a pair of dress up shoes and walked over to the nearby makeup. They were having a promotion so I bought my favorite kind to get a free bag and then checked out a new kind before I bought some and lipstick. Both were priced great. Next, I went to the housewares section and bought a coffee maker in black. Hand mixers were on sale across the isle so I bought one for the camp. The color I chose is red to match the blender. Next, I left the large store and went to nearby children's store to pick out toys for my kids. Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what they would like. Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give me to a little relief from daily laundry. After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead, I realized it was time to meet at the food court. Realizing it was all the way across the mall, I hurriedly walked that way and saw my friends and sisters standing in front waiting. We shared some strawberry ice cream and coffee before we walked back to our cars and said goodbye. As I drove home and thought about my purchases and good time with friends and family, I smiled. I live in a nice city."

I put on a pair of jeans and then I reached for my favorite black cardigan.  As I began to button it up I realized that one of the buttons had fallen off.  Of course I did not want to wear any other sweater, just this one as it was my favorite.  I went to my spare room and dug my sewing kit out of the dresser.  I found a thread and button that would match and I quickly threaded a needle.  I began to methodically move the needle through the holes in the button to sew it back onto the sweater.  After a few minutes I cut the thread and secured the button to the sweater.  Finally I was able to put my sweater on and head off to work."

He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas . "

I first decided which wall would best display the pictures. I picked the wall in the dining room. I put the paintings on the floor at the base of the wall to see how I would space the paintings. I then asked my daughter to hold one painting up so I could measure the distance from the ceiling with a measuring tape. I measure the distance and marked the wall with a pencil. I hammered a nail on the mark and then hung my pictures."

The room took about five minutes to reach the comfortable temperature that I set it at and we sat in the room for half an hour. As we relaxed in the room we had a conversation and when we felt as if we had spent enough time in the sauna we dried ourselves off with the towels that we brought with us to the room. After we dried off, we left the room and I turned off the thermostat, of the sauna, so that it could cool back down."

Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind it. I also lightly season it for flavor. I push it into the loaf pan, and put it in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them, but they taste so much fresher. I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice. When the oven dings, dinner is ready for my family and I to enjoy."

It looked like that light bulb had burned out. I went to the hall closet and poked around, and luckily I found just what I needed, a package of light bulbs just like the one that had burned out. I brought one of the new bulbs back to the living room, and unscrewed the old used-up light bulb. I put it on the kitchen counter so I would see it in the morning and remember to recycle it at our city's transfer station. Then I screwed the new light bulb into the light socket  and turned on the lamp. The light shone bright and clear. I settled back into my chair with a sigh, and opened my book again."

I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm, but not too hot. I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet. It is good to use shampoo and conditioner. First, I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head. This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily. After the shampoo is rubbed into my head, I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap. Once the soap is out, I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends. This keeps it nice and soft and healthy. I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a while, and then rinse it all out in the warm water. I dry off, and feel better knowing that my hair is nice and clean again."

Up until last year, I used a regular coffee pot, and would brew about six cups, and drink most of it. Last year, for my birthday, I got a Keurig machine that brews individual cups. It has become a hobby of mine to collect different coffee and tea flavors, and try something new. Today, I felt like having one of my fancier kinds of coffee. This kind is a Gevalia mocha latte. It tastes like a hot chocolate and coffee blended together. I added some water to my Keurig machine, and within a minute it was ready to brew. I put the k-cup into the slot on the machine, and added the chocolate packet to an empty coffee mug. Today I used my favorite teal coffee cup with birds and flowers on it. The machine sputtered out a delicious cup of coffee, I stirred the chocolate powder into the coffee until it was blended. I grabbed a chair at my kitchen table, drank my delicious high-calorie breakfast, and was ready to take on the day."

My first idea was to just buy it but when I went to the local bookstore it cost $ 20 . $ 20 for a book is more than I am willing to pay so I decided to go to the local library . Calling in ahead to make sure that they did indeed have the book that I wanted , I then headed in the direction of the library . When I arrive they had already had the book up front as I requested so that all I had to do was go pick it up . Or so I thought . In actuality I had to spend time getting a new library card . The librarian walked me through the process while also giving me a little background on the book I was about to read . After I had gotten my new library card I simply gave it to the librarian and she checked out the book for me . Now it is time to dig in to this novel"

I made a list of everyone that I wanted to invite. Then, I went to the store to buy the invitations. I looked through the rows of cards until I found the graduation invitation section, with one section specifically for college graduation. I looked through the selection of cards there until I found a few that I liked. Deciding that I wanted to send a variety of different cards to my friends, I bought a few of each card until I had enough cards for everyone. Then, I went to the cashier, purchased the cards, and went home. Once I got home, I wrote messages in each of the cards along with the names of each person that I was inviting. Then, I mailed the cards."

One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice. I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this! I went to my local farmer's market and got the biggest, juiciest oranges I could find. I got about ten oranges because I wasn't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband. I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink. It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use! I was excited to try it. I sliced all of my oranges in half and plugged the juicer in. I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice. To my luck, I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later. I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice, and he said that the juice was his favorite part!"

My driver was very cool and relaxed. Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so it was good to have such a laid back guy as my instructor. It helped to put all of the worries to rest. I was very nervous at first. But we started driving around town and I got more used to it. In the instructor's car, they have pedals on their side of the car as well. So that is a comfort knowing that they can take control of the car if anything goes wrong. That really helped to make me worry a lot less. Overall, it was a very good experience and I felt very comfortable by the end of it."

We were both very full and sat in momentary silence as we pondered the situation in front of us. We knew we had to clean the table off, but neither of us were particularly excited about the task at hand. At last, we came to a conclusion. I would clear the plates, silverware, napkins and drink glasses from the table and put them in the dishwasher. My wife would grab some wood-cleaner from underneath the cabinet so we could wipe down the table-top. After the plates, silverware, napkins and glasses were clear, she sprayed the wood cleaner across the surface of the table. She took a white rag and wiped the table top until she was satisfied that it was clean."

We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot.  We wanted to cook them, so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in their body and started a fire.  When the fire was getting calmed down, the hot coals started to steam.  When it started steaming, we got the fish out and put it on a cast iron pan.  We put the pan on the middle of the fire with the lid on it and we waited while the fish cooked.  It smelled really good to us, especially with how hungry that we were.  After it started to smell almost burned, we took the pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled."

I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks . I seemed to be a thousand times cleaner than I was before I got it . I even smelled great the whole entire day . "

Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the \"D\" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells me it's fine and to give it a little gas. The car begins to move forward as travel in a straight line. The more gas I give it from the pedal on the right, the faster we go!"

And I also looked at prices. I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick. The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by my front door. I opened it. It was the vitamins. It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick. Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me. I might order from Amazon again since they got here quick."

Some of the ingredients I already had - like olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and cumin. However, I needed many of the other necessary ingredients in order to make the recipe. On my shopping list, I wrote that I needed one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of cannellini beans, a bag of frozen corn, one red onion, one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper, and one bunch of cilantro. I put the shopping list in my purse so I could reference it later at the store and make sure I buy everything that I need for dinner."

Instead of being loud, like normal, it was fairly faint, and changing volume on it's own.  The light was also flickering a lot on the time readout.  I figured that the batteries were probably dying, so I decided to change them.  First, I looked in my cabinet to see if I had any spare batteries.  I didn't, so I drove to the grocery store to pick up some replacements.  I bought two AA batteries, and returned home with them.  I found my flat head  screwdriver in my tool box, and used it to pry open the battery compartment on the bottom of my alarm clock.  I then dislodged the old batteries with my fingers, and placed the new ones in the slots, with the positive and negative ends lining up appropriately.  Finally, I put the battery cover back on and saw the alarm clock light up brightly."

That button had 4 holes, so I wanted to fix in such a way that it looks good. So I had to choose exact matching color with my dress. The button was golden. I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up. Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way, then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole. When it went down, I pulled it all the way, and then, got it out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole. I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix it firmly with button. my job was done."

He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle . My nephew was very happy when he saw the cake . He was very surprised that I had baked a cake for him ."

I tore it open and dumped the food into his bowl that sat on the ground next to the wall. He quickly began to eat the food. Meanwhile, I washed out his water bowl in the sink and filled it with fresh, cold water. Then, I sat it down onto the floor right next to his food bowl. He soon finished his food and purred in appreciation. He drank some water and then quickly ran out of the room to hide under the bed and take a nap."

The main thing that we needed to worry about was having clothes for the week. Knowing this, we got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week. Then, we took some extra clothes for swimming just in case we would be doing this while we were over there. After the clothes, we made sure to pack our toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. We packed these in a small bag the day before we left. The last thing to pack was any other items we wanted to take with us. I decided to take a blanket, and my brother decided to take a pillow. We packed these into the suitcase, and once we were sure we had everything, we went off to our aunt's house."

I was so glad I did because they had sliding scale fee that drastically reduced the cost of doctor visits and specialists that I desperately needed to see. I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled. The date came and I went to see my new primary care provider. I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional. She ended up being incredibly kind and understanding and she gave me a referral to see a chiropractor. I was so happy that I was finally going to be able to see someone to help with my back pain. I dislike narcotic painkillers and over the counter pain killers just don't cut it most days. overall it was a positive experience and rather comedic that I was actually scared."

The party was going to start in 1 hour and it was time for her to get ready to go, so she ran as fast as she could into her room to grab her party clothes. When she reached into her drawer to grab her prettiest dress- It was a beautiful pink color with pretty purple flowers and polka dots on it- she found that the dress looked ruined! It was wrinkled and bunched up from being shoved into her drawer for so long underneath all her other clothes. She ran to her mom in a panic, saying she couldn't make it to the party with a ruined dress! Her mom smiled and told her it was going to be okay, then she pulled out something she called an Ironing Board, which she explained would help her get the wrinkles out of the pretty dress without hurting it. Her mom ironed the dress and sure enough, it was then free of wrinkles and she was ready to go to the birthday party!"

I crack my egg lightly on the counter top until the contents begin to ooze. I position my egg over the small pan and break the egg into two pieces, so that the egg lands on the small pan. I crack the yolk with my spatula. I then wait 3 minutes while the egg cooks. I sprinkle salt and pepper over the egg. When it is time, I flip the egg and repeat the process. When it is done, I remove the egg from the pan with my spatula and put the egg on a plate. It is time to eat."

I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up. I then brought the laundry basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet. I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron from the closet as well. I brought the iron to the sink so I could fill it in order to use the steam function. I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board. I plugged the iron's cord into the socket. As I heard the iron start to heat up, I set the first item to be ironed on the board. I flattened the pants on the board so the creases would be right at the seams. As I grazed the iron across the pants, the wrinkles started to erase and I continued the process with the rest of the clothing items in the basket."

In order to lessen the stress, I asked him if he would like to build a fort for us to play games in. He had the idea for us to eat pizza in the fort. Since our electricity was out, we could not bake one. We decided we could order a pizza. I gave him the choices of the crust and he chose thin crust. I gave him the choice of toppings and he just wanted pepperoni and cheese. I got his half with pepperoni and my half with vegetables. We put in our order and added some chicken bites, for some extra protein. We built our fort while we waited for the pizza to arrive. The pizza came and we had a pizza fort party by lantern light. I was an amazing memory from a situation that was less than positive."

I already had the noodles at my house. I drove my car to my nearest supermarket. I grabbed a shopping cart and entered the store. I strolled the aisles until I found the Italian food isle. I looked around for my favorite spaghetti sauce and found it. i put it into my shopping cart and proceeded to go to the bakery section. I ordered some freshly baked Italian bread rolls. I put all the items into my shopping cart and started making my way towards the cashier check out. I placed my items on the cashier desk and paid for my items. After paying I went back to my car in the parking lot and placed the items inside my car. I drove home and started boiling the pasta and heating up the spaghetti sauce. I put the bread into the oven to heat it up. After 20 minutes the meal was ready and I sat down at the table with my family and enjoyed the meal. When I was done I washed the dishes and dinner was finished."

As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way . First I saw large suburban areas but as we got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted . It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere . Soon we approached NYC and the train came to slow stop , we had arrived at our destination . The ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long . "

They were swimming around and ready to be fed. I grabbed my jar of fish food and screwed the cap. Then I scooped out just enough food to feed them for one day. The scooped food went right into the water. My fish were in a slight frenzy to get fed. They swam all at once to the surface to eat up the food that I had given them. In a short while, most of the food had disappeared from the surface of the water. The fish appeared to be eating healthily so i began to put things away. I then closed the top of the tank, and replaced the cap on the fish food. I put the food away for another day."

There are several bills I have to pay each month with money I earn from working. They include: my mortgage, car payment, cell phone, TV/internet, electric, and credit card bills. I set some time aside to check what I owe on each bill. The mortgage is usually the highest. Most bills I can pay online by using my computer. I go the the website, enter an amount, and within a few clicks, it is paid for. My car payment doesn't have an easy-to-use online pay system, so for that I use my checkbook. I take a check and write out the amount, who I am paying it to (the bank), and sign my name. I then put the check in an envelope with the bank's address on it, attach a stamp, and drop it off at my local mail box. It's not a long, or hard task, but it's something I must do each month."

I liked the tripadvisor, after reviewing the site, and looking at the customer reviews. The number was on site. When I first talked to him, he gave me some options I  think I got good deal, $1300 for round trip with stop at London for 14 hours and then directly to Singapore. I liked that way because I wanted to see London also.  It was good timing that I could go out see London and come back, and still I was left with ease. I asked the agent, about any delaying problem, and cancellation. He told me if I add more $50 dollars, then I can change or cancel my trip without any penalty , and I did."

I have to assume it must be the batteries. I take the old batteries out of the alarm clock and look them over for corrosion. They look fine, so maybe they are just old. I place the new batteries in the alarm clock and I make sure they make contact with the metal parts and face the right direction. Check. I slide the back of the alarm clock back on and flip the clock over. I turn the on switch on and it lights up. All I have to do now is reset the time and I'm good to go."

She has to vacuum the living room and hallway for those days.  So, on one of these days, she takes out the vacuum cleaner, unwinds the cord, plugs it in, and adjusts the height of the vacuum.  This way, it is low to the ground, and gets all the dirt up.  She then hits the button for start, and it turns on.  She pushes it gently across the carpet and floors of the living room and hallway. She makes sure that she gets the edges and under any carpets that are movable. She also vacuums under the front of the couch.  When she is done, she turns off the machine, empties the dirt into the trash can, and pops the container back onto the vacuum.  She rolls up the cord, and returns it back to the closet."

Now I know what your thinking, and you cannot just grab any ole fish out of a tank or something you found in a stream. You need a good fish with lots of meat and food on it. My favorite fish to cook is probably drum, so once you have a good nice drum you first have to cut it. Get all the meat off of it and then there are a number of ways to cook it. I like to fry my fish, so I season it with a number of thinks and then make sure to cover it in flour and bread crumbs. I then heat the oil I will be using to fry it to a very hot temperature and then dunk the fish in the oil until it is nice and brown."

The suitcases are stored in the walk-in closet so they are brought out into the living room. We need to decide what kind of clothing we'll need, so let's turn on the Weather Channel. Since it is going to be very warm with no rain during our trip we will pack mostly summer clothes. Each person will need three shorts and tops so there are clothes for each day and an extra outfit if needed. Fold everything nicely so it does not wrinkle and all clothing fits in the suitcase. Let's move on to the bathroom and pack tooth care supplies like a toothbrush, mouthwash, and toothpaste. Deodorant , make-up, perfume, and cologne also go in now. Put these items in the side pocket of the suitcase to be reached quickly. Everyone pack one sweatshirt and light jacket in case it is colder at night. Grab swimsuits and trunks too, for the water park, and bring sandals and sneakers. Now all we have to do is pack our towels for the water park, get the tickets and money packed, and leave the house to start our trip."

Of course we were all over 21 so there weren't any issues. We all went in and found us a table. We then decided to order some drinks and about that time a waitress came over and asked us what we would like to have. We all gave her our order and she went to get the drinks. While she was away a good song started playing and we all decided to dance. We all went out on the dance floor and danced until the end of the song. We went back to our table and our drinks arrived as soon as we got back. We all drank our drink and decided to dance some more. We stayed for a few hours and danced. We all then decided it was time to go home. We all went to the door. We told one another bye and we all left and went home."

I squirt some into my hand, about the size of a quarter. I wet my hair and then rub in the shampoo. I scrub my hair and can feel all the suds forming on my head. After a few minutes of this I carefully rinse the soap out of my hair. I don't want to get it in my eyes. I then grab my bottle of conditioner and repeat what I did with the shampoo. This time though I leave it sit for a couple minutes so many hair can soak up those nutrients. I then rinse off again making sure there's no soap what so ever left.  I shut off the shower and dry off, my hair now squeaky clean."

Then I folded the bottom of the shirt upward and the top downwards.  After shirts, I moved on to underpants.  I folded them halfways from the center and then top to bottom.  Next came pants.  I lined up the seams and folded them in half longways, and then from the top to the center then the bottom to the center.  I matched up socks and laid one on top of the other.  Then I took the cuffs about a third of the way down to keep each with it's matching partner.  Then I put my folded clothes away in drawers."

In order to do this, we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box. We then boiled the water, before putting the pasta in. As we put the pasta in, we stirred it and watched the water boil. After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes, we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat. Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste, we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot. Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot, we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta. This tasted amazing and I felt that it was perfectly tasty and hot."

We talked about how old the bed was and talked about buying a new bed. We helped each other put the blankets on the bed. I put the pillows on the bed, but my wife did not like how I arranged them. So she arranged the pillows how she wanted them. Later I saw her in bed. She said that she thought she was sick. So I brought her breakfast in bed. She smiled."

I put the clothes into the washing machine. I then put laundry soap in. I also put about a cup of bleach in. Bleach helps make the white clothes stay white. I turned on the washing machine by setting the dial to the the amount of time to wash the clothes. I also set a knob for how full the washer was. I also set the temperature of the water. After the clothes were done washing I put them into the dryer. I set the dryer for 30 minutes because I think that is how long it will take to try them. I did everything above for the colored clothes except put in bleach. I only washed 2 loads of clothes."

We also talked about what the future could hold for all of us. We were starting on a new road soon, we were all getting a fresh start, and it was so very exciting. I couldn't wait to start college in the fall as I'm sure most of my friends felt the same way.

I open the refrigerator and grab two eggs out of the carton. Cracking the eggs against the side of the dish gently and then open them over the bowl, making sure there is no shell in the bowl I then toss the shells into the trash can behind me. I put a splash of cream, milk or water into the eggs and then beat them furiously with a fork or whisk. I then grab the soft butter from next to the toaster and put one pat into the pan. I turn the burner on and once the butter starts to sizzle I pour the beaten eggs into the pan, add a little salt and pepper and wait until they are semi firm. I then grab a spatula and chop the eggs up and let the carry over heat cook the eggs the rest of the way."

I went to the local store which had a Red Box video vending machine outside of it.  I looked over the selections it had till I found the one I wanted.  I put my credit card into the slot for paying and purchased a copy of the movie to watch.  I took the copy from the machine and headed home after stopping at the store to buy some popcorn for the movie.  I placed it into the DVD and watched the movie while enjoying the popcorn.  The movie and the popcorn were great.  When I was done I popped the DVD out of the machine and went back to the store to return the movie to the Red Box video vending machine.  It was an excellent experience and I will definitely do it again."

That makes opening the gift more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble my wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I  study it, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I don't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the paper along the fold line. Now I turn the gift upside down, and position it in the center of my paper. I pull up one end of the paper, and tape it to the center bottom of the box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull it around  the box and tape it in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the paper down, cutting it shorter if I must, and smoothing it neatly around the gift box. I tape it in place, and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made."

In fact, I'm not sure when I will return to the location that I am in right now. I first entered my toiletries, including my tooth brush, hair brush, and deodorants. I also threw some cologne in there. Then, I added my clothes, including pants, shirts, socks, underwear - boxers, not briefs. Additionally, I added shaving cream, a few snacks, my electronics, including my phone, my phone charger, my electric razor charger, and batteries for my phone, as an additional comfort for when I cannot get a charge. I also loaded up with a couple pillows and a nice blanket, for this luxurious vacation. Hopefully I will be enjoying my trip, and with a suitcase as full as this one, I better."

The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in. The day was sunny and above eighty degrees. I wore my teal one-piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini. After we had walked to the pool from our house, we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs. There were only a dozen people at the pool. One of them was my sister's friend, so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft. I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" while the sun heated my skin. When I started to sweat, I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps. Thankfully, the lap swim lane was clear, and I got a good work-out in. The day started to cloud over, and my sister's friend left, so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time. We wrapped ourselves in our towels, put our flip-flops on, and walked home from the pool."

The showtime wasn't for another 30 minutes. So we decided to go the arcade next door and play some games. They have real old classic arcade games there.  Remember Galaga? Donkey Kong? Even the old Star Wars simulator. That was my favorite game when I was a kid...  Once we're inside the theater, we bought some candies, popcorn, and some drinks. With our hands full with goodies, we headed into viewing room. It was already packed with people. We find a pair of good seats towards the back. There are nice old couple seated towards the aisle. We approached the seats and asked with a smile, \"Can we get by here? Thank you.\" Nice folks replied with a smile and said, \"Why of course my dear, Go on in.\" We sat down and enjoyed the movie with a handful of popcorn and an occasional slurp of the soda."

After drying each one, I put it aside to dry. Soon after, everything was cleaned and I was able to start putting everything away. I put everyone in the same spot that it always goes in and this continued in this example as well.

I picked her up from her crib and held her close as I walked towards the rocking chair in the nursery. I pulled down the shoulder of my nightgown and unhooked the nursing bra I was wearing so the baby could latch onto my breast and eat. She didn't like having a bottle, so nursing was our best option to keep her happy and fed. She nursed for half an hour and slowly, as she got full, her eyes started to droop shut. I started to sing her a lullaby, soft and sweet, and she soon fell asleep. I wiped some milk from the corner of her mouth with a tissue, and set her back down in her crib so she could sleep until it was time to eat again."

Some garbage bags have ties or strings that are attached to them and can be used to close the top of the garbage bag by pulling on the strings until the opening completely closes. Then the ends of the strings can be tied in a knot so the bag will not open. If the bag does not have strings attached, use a twist tie to close the opening by gathering the top of the bag together and wrapping the twist tie around the end of the bag and twisting the ends of the twist tie together. Take the full, closed garbage bag outside so the garbage man can pick it up. Then, take a new garbage bag out of the box and unfold it before putting it in the garbage can. You can fold the top edge of the garbage bag over the rim of the can so that garbage does not get between the can and the bag."

While the milk is heating up I get mix cocoa and sugar together. I have to be careful while boiling milk because once I did it for too long. Then a skin formed on top and it was gross. I learned after that that as soon as it boils I need to pull it off the burner.Once the milk comes to a boil I pour it into a mug. Then I add the cocoa. Then I stir and enjoy it in front of my fireplace."

The shopping centre was a little bit of a drive from her home but she thought that it was worth all the gas money. When sally got to the shopping centre she saw clothes, new phones, and books! She was so excited to be there she had not gone to this particular shopping centre before. Sally's first thought was to go to the book store and see what kind of new hits that she wanted to read. She made it to the book section and picked out a book that was titled: the magical uses and wonders of Flippity Floppity Bibbity Boppity Boo. and she thought it was wonderful so she brought it up to the counter and paid for the book. Sally was getting tired after all that shopping so she got back in her car and went home. she had to stop at the gas station to fuel up her car and then when she was done, she got back in the car and drove home. she was very tired so she went to sleep. Goodnight Sally."

I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place. I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter. I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting. I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun. Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it. Afterwards, I cleaned all the windows, inside and out, and moved to the bathroom. After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner, I took a look around my flat to assess my work. My apartment was now clean and it felt great!"

And I take the dishes to the sink. Next I get the silverware and take them to the sink. If there is food left I remove the food from the table and put the food into bowls to be saved in the refrigerator as left overs. Glasses, coffee cups and dessert plates will be removed from table.

The other day it dawned on mt that I could buy my own tattoo machine online. I researched tattoo machines, needles and inks for the better part of a month at different online retailers before I decided on a retailer. I then researched the product and how to use it for a few more weeks. I watched videos about the product, tutorials and user reviews. I figured since I am an artist and pretty good at drawing and tracing that I would give it a go. I saved up amazon gift cards for several more weeks. It took a while but I eventually saved the better part of a hundred dollars, one dollar gift card at a time. I decided to finally make my purchase and the product arrived two days later."

I decided to change my sheets, since they were off anyway. First, I removed all the sheets and comforter. I placed the comforter on the side. I gathered up the sheets and pillow cases and brought them to the laundry. Next, I got out another set of clean sheets. I unfolded the fitted sheet, that has elastic around the edges. I stretched the sheet over each corner, making a nice tight area. Next, I put the flat sheet on, tucking in the bottom and the sides. Next, I replaced the comforter, being sure that all the sides were hanging over the same amount. I put clean pillow cases on the pillows and put them at the head of my bed. Now, my bed was beautifully made with clean sheets!"

You see, lunch time is a time of the day when you get to get out of your desk to move around and get to go to places that will serve you food. Well at this place they served me a pumpkin. I said to the waiter, this is not what I had placed my order for. The waiter said that he was sorry and took the pumpkin back. Then he brought out the grilled salmon that I had ordered. I was suspicious of the salmon because what restaurant accidentally serves a pumpkin instead of a grilled salmon. That does not inspire confidence."

I plugged  it in the it in the power outlet.  I turned on the vacuum. I cleaned in rows, so I do not skip any area. Then, I attached flat vacuum to clean the sides of walls and the area under the furniture. the sound was very loud  I placed  the bottom of the vacuum on the carpet . I vacuumed all of the carpet and it was finally all clean . I called my family to all look at it. It was good and I was finally done with it."

I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake , printed out a list of the ingredients , and went to the grocery store to get them . I knew about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped me get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get . When I got home , I followed the recipe as closely as I could , adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked for . I mixed them all up as described , and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from my mother . I put the pan in the oven and let the cake cook . I checked on it occasionally to see if it was looking OK , and because I was really excited to see how it was turning out . When it was done in the oven I removed it , and applied an extra thick coat of frosting . I was supposed to wait for the cake to cook , but I was too excited to try it out and ate it much sooner than recommended . It was delicious !"

It looked like he had a fever. He had gone to the doctor a few days ago. He had a prescription from them, but he wasn't able to take the medicine himself. He needed it. I went to the cupboard we kept it in and took out the medicine. It was in a small bottle. The medicine was liquid, so it was easy to administer. I opened the bottle. Then I measured out a single dose into its cap. I set the cap of medicine down on the counter before grabbing a small glass of water. With both the medicine and the water in my hand, I went back to his room. He opened his mouth for me. I pressed the cap to his mouth, making sure he drank all of it. Then he had some water."

All that you need is to have your passport ready if you are going to be going on an international flight if not all you need is a photo ID but in this case my flight was international. After your boarding pass is printed you need to take your luggage to get it checked in a well and it gets weighted and if its over the specific weight that is allowed you might be asked t pay an excess weight fee."

She pulls the corners down around the corners of the bed until it is tight. Then she puts the top sheet on her bed and tucks in the bottom part of her top sheet.  Then she takes the pillow cases and puts one on each pillow, to make a fresh clean bed.  She puts her cover on last, it is a blue one with little flowers.  She loves it, it came from her grandmother from Christmas. She fluffs the pillows and puts her favorite teddy bear to rest on the pillows as decoration."

I decided to pull out our lawnmower from the shed in our backyard.  There are several kinds of lawnmowers, but the kind of lawnmower we own in gas-powered.  Because our lawnmower had no gas in it, I pulled a gas storage container off of a high shelf in our backyard shed and filled the gas tank.  To start the lawnmower, I pulled the starting cable vigorously a few times.  The lawnmower's motor roared to loud life and I began pushing it through the grass in the yard in a methodical back-and-forth pattern so the grass would be evenly and neatly cut.  This made our front yard look so good, I decided to mow the backyard's lawn as well!"

I put all my things on the belt and a bagger bagged them as the cashier scanned . The bagger set the bags in my cart , and I took the bags out to my car .

I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained, and that the mirrors were filthy. I then set aside all of the necessary cleaners to use in the bathroom, and got to work. I first worked on the counter tops. I used a special marble cleaner to clean them, and it really made them shine. After the counters, I did the mirrors. I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done, and by the time I finished, the mirrors were spotless. Lastly, I took care of the toilet. I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters, and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl. Just for good measure, I mopped the floor of the bathroom, washed out the bathtub with shower cleaner, and sprayed the room with air freshener to make it smell nice."

I slid the nozzle into the fuel tank and started to pump. I watched the gauge carefully to be sure I knew how much I was getting, and how much money I was spending. When I had a full tank, the pump stopped all on its own! I put the nozzle back in the holster on the side of the, screwed the gas cap back in place, and closed the panel. I was ready for my trip!"

She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic. Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation. I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you. I told Jasmine that I will plan to take her to some of the best restaurants in town and plan a big shopping trip. During our phone call, we also talked about the days when we were in college together. After a while of talking, we decided that it was time to get off the phone and take care of some things at home. I really enjoyed our conversation."

I decided to run to the Redbox booth to get a new movie that was out.  I got my keys and went to the booth.  I paid with my card for the movie that we wanted.  I drove back to our house and I got the DVD out of the case.  I own a PS4, so I placed the DVD right into the machine without opening the console.  I had to get the controller out of a drawer to play, but I found it easy to find out where to start the movie.  We all relaxed on the couch and ate some candy while we watched the movie.  We laughed at the funny parts and stayed awake for the whole movie, even when it got a little boring."

When I noticed her doing this, I walked to the kitchen cabinet where her food is kept and pulled out one small can of tuna and chicken flavored wet cat food, which is her favorite. She saw that I did this and affectionately brushed up against my legs. I opened the can using the pull tab on top of the lid, and used a spoon to scrape all of the food out of the can and into her food dish. She immediately went to her dish, and had eaten all of her food within a few minutes. I also placed water into her water bowl, which she lapped up after finishing her cat food."

Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market.  When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up.  When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish he buys still has the head, fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. I like it better when he leaves the scales (skin) of the fish as it tastes really good. There are many different ways that he cooks the fish. Sometimes he will  fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it.  He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi.  In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it.  My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain."

The world was new in a sense, and I can  vividly see myself the morning I first awoke in my new home. I went to making scrambled eggs, and these eggs were not any ordinary eggs. They were the most amazing eggs that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was not just the combination of being in a new place and starting new that made the eggs better. It was as if in that moment in my life, everything synced together so perfectly, that these scrambled eggs I made were just the cherry on top of my life's Sunday."

I started remembering all the things we did together. It made me very happy. I finished the letter and got ready to go and post it. Nowadays most of the people have stopped writing letters. They all keep in touch through emails. Letters are something very personal. We can preserve the letters of our loved ones and some beautiful memories along with it.  Slowly letter writing has been taken over by messages, Facebook and emails, WhatsApps etc. I and my friend only write letters to each other because we feel this is a better way to keep in touch."

We had a great time , but were very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean . After unpacking the car , I had to take a bath . I love our deep soaking tub . I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family . "

I work construction for my job so I need to have something that is able to tow and haul a lot of weight. One of the unfortunate side effects of owning such a large, mean truck, however, is the need to constantly put fuel in it! I usually go to the gas station twice a week to fill up my tank and empty my wallet. I pick a pump at my favorite gas station that is easy to drive into so I don't risk hitting other vehicles. I hop out and insert my credit card into the pump machine. After my card is read, I pull the gas nozzle off of the machine and insert it into my truck. I wait for what seems like forever as the pump fills my tank and the dollar amount endlessly increases."

Then I wrote \"Dear Mom and Dad\" on the first line. I kept writing all the words I needed to use in order to convince my parents to let me come home. Then I signed the letter with my name. I folded the letter in half and then folded it in half again so that it would fit in an envelope. Then I put the letter in an envelope. I taped the envelope shut. Then I stuck a stamp on the upper right corner of the envelope. I wrote my parent's address on the middle of the envelope and then I walked to the camp office and gave my letter to the secretary so she could mail it for me."

It was around 11 am when we reached the mountain. There was a small pond with lots of ducks. My brother and me played for some time in the water. We played hide and seek for some time. My family was having a good time, all of us were chatting, playing and singing. It was around 1 pm. We were hungry now. We washed our hands and took out the food which my parents had packed. My mother laid out the food in separate plates. I served it to everyone. We ate our food very quickly as we were all hungry.The food was delicious. We started playing cards after lunch. It was around 4 pm when we decided to leave. We packed our things and left. It was a fun day for all of us."

Also it avoids bacteria and viruses that cause illness. Now I prepare to clean my floor. For that I have cleaning equipment in my store room.First I open the store room. From there I will collect my cleaning equipments. First I will take the vacuum cleaner. By using the vacuum cleaner, I clean the yesterday dust and dirt. After that I will take one bucket of water. In that water I will mix \"antibacterial surface cleaner\".Then by using a mop I will clean the floor as well. After the cleaning my floor was looking good and hygienic.

I grabbed several stalks of celery and a carrot, washed them, and peeled the carrot with a peeler.  Then, I placed the carrot on the cutting board and sliced it lengthwise.  After splitting the carrot, I proceeded to use my knife to chop the two sides into small half circles.  Following this, I washed off the several stalks of celery I picked out, and chopped off the ends, throwing them away.  I then sliced each stalk of celery lengthwise, before chopping them into smaller pieces.  Finally, I picked a large potato, washed all the dirt off of it, and peeled it.  I used the large knife to cut it lengthwise and then chop it into bite sized pieces for use in the soup."

We had traveled to the beach and we thought the beach would make a wonderful backdrop for our picture.  We told everyone what time we wanted to take the picture and walked down to meet at the beach.  Everyone showed up, but there was still a problem.  Who was going to take the picture?  Luckily, there was an older couple on the beach who came up to us.  They offered to take the photo while we posed.  We were so grateful.  They snapped a few pictures and gave the camera back to us.  We talked to them for a while and expressed our gratitude.  After that, we went to a local photo shop to develop our pictures.  They came out better than we thought!"

Reaching in the fridge, I pulled out the coffee, placed a filter in the coffee maker and added the water to the machine. While the coffee maker made the coffee, I decided to pour myself a bowl of cereal. As I ate, the aroma of the coffee filled the kitchen with a rich, earthy smell, letting me know that my hot drink was ready. I quickly went to cabinet, pulled out my favorite mug, and filled it with coffee and just a little bit of creamer and sugar. After finishing my first cup of coffee, I poured a second cup into a thermos that I could take with me to work, and finished getting ready for the day. After a little jolt of caffeine, I was ready to take on anything the day might throw at me!"

I had to find out a number of things, but the most important one was figuring out who I could invite to the party. After I had a good enough idea, I went to the store and bought several themed party invitations. After buying the invitations, I spent a long time writing names and addresses for people that I wanted to invite to the party. After finishing the writing and putting all of the invitations in envelopes, I put stamps on them so they could all be mailed out as soon as possible. I made sure that all of the invitations had stamps and the correct addresses of the people who would be getting them, and put them in my mailbox for the postman to take them to the post office to be sent off. On the day of the party, almost everyone I sent an invitation to came to the party, and that made my brother very happy."

Because there were so many of them, I ran out of room and had to stack them one on top of the other. Well, I stacked them so high that they kept falling over. Thankfully, none of them were made of glass. But, it was really funny because no matter how hard I tried, I could not get them to stack right. Finally, I had to stop washing the dishes and start drying them so I could make room for more clean dishes. I would wash a batch, then dry them, and then wash the next batch. It took me almost a half hour to finish them!"

She asked me where I lived, and I told her. Then she asked me if it looked like the man had a weapon. I said I didn't think so. She told me not to worry, but to stay inside. Then she told me the police were on the way. She talked to me until they arrived. She wanted to know how old I was, and where I went to school. She also asked me about how things were going outside. He was still yelling. But soon the police came, and took him away. I felt better."

I turned this machine on attached it to the pants and began to sew. I noticed that the pants slowly begun to get fixed. Upon finishing, I turned off the machine and checked to make sure that my pants were completely fixed. I noticed that they were and tried them on. Once I tried them on, I realized that they were indeed fixed and I felt good that they were back to working. I then wore them and walked around and put away the sewing machine for the day."

The camera was beautiful, but the photographs it took were even more beautiful. Anyway, I was strolling through the woods. I had my camera, and I pictured a good shot. I then took my camera out and aimed it. I aimed well, and I captured the best photograph that anyone has ever taken. Or at least, in my opinion anyways. Well, back to the photograph. It was taken of a scene in the woods, one of those dark, forested scenes that makes you dread your own existence. It was of a large tree, next to another tree, next to another tree, in the forest. There was a beam of light casting through the frame. It was exhilarating. I can still see the photo now, burning a hole in my mind's eye. What a day."

I walk into the kitchen.  I open the cabinet and take out a can of coffee.  It is a new can so I have to open with the can opener.  I line the basket with a disposable paper liner for easier clean up.  Next I get a spoon out of the drawer and measure out a large scoop of coffee and add to the filter basket.  Just the smell is helping me to wake up.  I measure out two more scoops of coffee. I then put the filter into the coffee maker. I then take the carafe and fill with water.  This is then poured into the coffee pot.  I hit the on button and wait a couple of minutes.  Then I pour the hot coffee into a mug and start to feel better."

I checked and the lamp was plugged and circuit breaker not tripped so I checked the bulb in the lamp.  Further inspection revealed the bulb was brown so I knew it had burned out and needed replacement.  Not having any extra in the house, I decided to go to the local Home Depot to buy the bulb I need.  I checked the store and looked at the wide variety of available bulbs to purchase.  I finally settled on a 75 Watt equal LED bulb and went to the counter to make my purchase.  The clerk was friendly on check out and I got the five dollars from my wallet to buy the home.  I then drove home and returned to my house.  I found the lamp in my living room and unscrewed the old bulb in the lamp after making sure the lamp was turned off.  I then screwed in the new light bulb, flipped the power switch, and the light came on.  Voila!"

I did three loads of laundry but I was so tired that I tossed all of the clothes onto the couch without folding them.  I woke the next morning feeling a bit refreshed and decided that is was time to tackle the pile of clothing on the couch.  First I separated the clothes into heaps based on clothing type and then I began folding all of the items.  I used to work in a clothing store so I began folding my clothes very precisely.  I folded everything neatly and made piles based on how the clothes would be stores in my closet.  Once all of the clothes were folded I returned them all to their proper places in my closet and I was ready to start my day."

Once I selected the pan, I poured the milk into the pan, and turned the heat on the stove top to medium high heat. For the next ten minutes, I constantly stirred the milk as it heated, to evenly distribute heat and to reduce the risk of the milk burning in the pan. After ten minutes of heating, the milk came to a boil, so I removed the pan from the heat, ready to use my sterilized milk to make cottage cheese."

I crack my eggs into a bowl and whisk it up to make some scrambled eggs. But I need to cook the bacon first. I cook the bacon in butter until golden brown and crispy. My pan is full of oil and butter. I am going to scramble my eggs in that. It will be deliciously decadent. I scramble my eggs in rendered fat and butter mix until they're almost done. Then I put the eggs and the bacon on the plate. along with the bagel with cream cheese slathered all over it. It's time to eat. I need a dollop of pico de gallo for my eggs. Perfect."

She started , and the first thing she did was put her name, the time of the party, and where the party was, on each card.  Then she wrote, \" Please come! Love, Beth\" on each one.

Beth helped her mother gather the envelopes together, and they drove to the post office to mail them.

Every Tuesday, the movie theaters have cheap days, where you can go see a movie for $5, and then buy a drink and small snack for $5 too. So, we check online to see when the movies are playing, and we decide what we will see.  Then, once we do that, we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the movie begins.  We park, and get out and stand in line for the tickets.  We usually all buy our own tickets, and then go in and order a drink and snack.  After that, we all go into the theater, and take our seats.  The movie always has previews before the real movie begins, so we have time to talk a little before the movie starts.  It also gives you time, if you were running late, to get there so you don't miss the movie.  We have a great time."

I asked my friend Ryan to help me put new wall paper up. He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work. I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan. We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls. It required us to brush down the paper so it would stick. We checked to make sure everything was even. I did not want uneven wall paper. After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones. We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went. Finally after applying the new sheets we cut the excess paper away. I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh. Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend."

Everyone in her family was dressed nicely, and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held.  As the entered the room, there was a strong smell of flowers that made June's nose ache a little.  Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names, and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered.  At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha's body lying in it. The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha. She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes.  Her make up and hair didn't really look like she used to wear them, but she didn't look scary like June had imagined.  They met some family members that were sad and crying, but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha.  They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front  of the room.  When the curtains opened back up, the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top.  A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha, and prayed.  The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery.  Afterwards, the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery.  June's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha's casket in the back.  A police man escorted the group of cars, and stopped traffic so the funeral procession didn't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery.  As they pulled up to the gravesite, June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath, and a metal frame around a hole in the ground.  The family gathered around the tent as the pallbearers carried Aunt Martha's casket to the gravesite and placed it on the frame over the hole.  The pastor said a few brief words and prayer again, and then Aunt Martha's casket was lowered into the ground.  The family talked a little while, and then drove over to Aunt Martha's house to have a wake.  There they ate food prepared by a local church for the family, and talked about the good times they had with Aunt Martha when she was alive."

As the pan begins to heat, I crack my eggs, add a little milk and mix thoroughly. I think my pan is ready and pour my eggs in while moving them slowly with the spatula. I sprinkle them lightly with salt and pepper and continue stirring. As they start to firm up in areas, I lower the heat and continue stirring just long enough until my eggs look slightly set. I don't like them too runny. I can now slide them off onto my plate and turn off the stove. I have a nutritious meal in minutes."

I flipped the lever on the left side of the steering column up for the right blinker and down for the left. Both arrows under the speedometer blinked and on the outside of the car in the front and back. Next we got in and fastened our seat belts, then I checked the side mirrors and rear view to make sure I could see. I inserted the keys into the ignition and using my thumb and first finger pushed the switch forward. I checked the mirrors again to make sure all people, animals, and objects where out of the way. I pulled the gear shift towards me and pulled down one click going from P (park) to R (reverse). I check the mirrors once more and turned my head to the right to look over my shoulder to back out of the driveway. At the end of the driveway, I pushed the turn signal lever down to signal I was turning left. I looked to the right and to the left to check for traffic twice and pulled out."

I called Domino's to leave my order, and told them exactly what I wanted in a size medium. I did not order anything else when they asked me if I would like anything in addition! They then asked me if I would like delivery or pick up. I wanted to spend the evening relaxing after a long day and just watch movies with my pizza, so I opted for delivery. Twenty minutes later the delivery man arrived at my door with my pizza. I pull out my debit card and swiped it, because that was my preferred method of payment. I then had to sign for using my debt card, and also made sure I filled in the empty line that said tip bedside it. I made sure to leave the delivery man a generous one since he was here in a timely manner and was quite polite in dealing with me. After he proceeded back to his car,  I sat down on the couch and ate my pizza while watching one of my favorite movies. It was a successful evening and the pizza was scrumptious!"

I decided to set the dining room table for dinner, rather than have us all eat around the coffee table in the living room like my partner and I usually do. First, I chose the tablecloth. We have a purple tablecloth, a light blue snowflake patterned tablecloth, and a bright colored floral tablecloth. I chose the floral one because I felt it was most appropriate for summertime. Next, I put a cloth napkin at each place and set utensils on top of the napkin - a knife, fork, and spoon. Then I placed a plate at each setting, four in total. I added a water glass at each setting as well. Then I put out the salt and pepper in the middle of the table so it was accessible to everyone. Lastly, I lit two candles and placed them in the center of the table as well. The dining room table looked great and ready for a dinner party."

I stayed in there for only about ten minutes because it was so hot and steamy.  When I got out, I turned the sauna off to save energy and took a cool shower.  I got out of the shower and dried off.

In another pan, I add some olive oil and starting cooking some broccoli and some chicken. I had plenty of garlic and spices. That is how I like it. After the pasta is cooked, I add it to the other pan with the chicken and broccoli. I add in the alfredo sauce and stir it. After about two minutes, the meal is nice and hot and ready to enjoy. She loved the meal and we had a great time together that night."

Then I walked three blocks to the swimming pool. It was crowded, but I was able to find an available lounge chair on the side of the pool. I put my things down and took the sunscreen out of the bag. I prayed the sunscreen all over my body. Then I laid down on the chair to relax. After about twenty minutes, I was ready to go in the water and go swimming. I swam five laps and then I was ready to get out. I got out of the pool, toweled off, and laid down on the chair again. It was a nice day."

The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red, which we thought looked strange. We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper, and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality. We first went to Sherwin-Williams, which is a paint and wallpaper store. We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls. We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls, and selected that color. We then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper. We then applied the wallpaper to our walls and stood back to admire our work."

I need to pack forks, spoons, knives, napkins, cups, paper towels, a couple of garbage bags and few zip top backs for leftovers. I'll make a shooter sandwich with meat and cheese. Since it's smashed, it will travel well and it can be cut up in advance. I'll also pack the potato salad in a container, some chips, and pretzels. Maybe some Boursin dip for both. I will also pack some pre-made sangria and lemon water in spill-proof bottles. I think chocolate chip cookies are great picnics too. They can go in a container so they don't get crushed.

It's normal, average, boring. Except this one time.... A cousin had taken our ride-on mower to do some maintenance on it. He had taken it on a Friday evening and had promised it would be back by Sunday evening. He was wrong. Sunday and Monday came and went with no sign of our lawn mower. Tuesday evening came and the grass was up to your ankles. It needed to be cut. We had bought a small push mower to get into the small spaces so we pulled it out. Me, my wife and my mother-in-law took turns pushing that mower up and down the yard for a good two hours. We had one tiny little bit left of the yard when Howard, the cousin, pulled up with the push mower."

Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.  But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like, the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal."

When Penny was five she asked me to show her how to take photos. She needed her own small camera so she can learn. We went to the store and bought Penny her first camera. We then went to the dog park. Penny loves dogs and wanted to photograph them. We arrived at the park and sat down on a bench so I can teach her how to use her camera. She opened the box and got her camera out. Penny pressed the big red button and the camera cut on. I showed her how to hold the camera correctly and how to take her first photo. Since then, Penny has learned how to take beautiful photographs. She is planning to teach other children how to take photos."

Anyhow, I put the gas into the mower, but it would not start. I think it needed some more oil. I but a bit of oil in and it started right up. I mowed in rows as I usually do. There were several sticks on the ground I had to pick up. I don't like mowing over sticks. There was a turtle hiding in the bushes while I was mowing. I had to lock my dog inside the house. My dog would chase the lawn mower if I didn't."

My mom always buys tickets ahead of time to make sure we have tickets since the theater is a little distance away. Once we are at the theater we pick up our pre ordered tickets. We then head to the snack line. While waiting in the line we all decide what snacks we want. I love to get popcorn with lots of butter, a pickle and a large Dr. Pepper. After we get our snacks we head to the theater to watch the movie. Once inside, we pick out what seats we would like. We don't want to be too close or too far, the middle is the perfect spot. Once we get settled the movie starts. Everyone is quietly watching the movie until it is over. Then we all drive back home."

I turned the heat all the way up so that the water would get hot quickly.  When the kettle started to whistle, that let me know the water was hot.  I poured the water into a mug, being very careful not to burn myself.  I scooped out some tea leaves into a little tea infuser, which I put in my mug.  After several minutes, I felt like the tea was probably strong enough to start drinking.  I like to add a little honey to my tea to make it sweet.  After I finished my cup of tea, there was enough hot water to make more! I poured water into a thermos, added more tea to the tea infuser, and sealed it up tight so that I'd have some nice strong tea ready to drink when I got to work."

I took off the blankets, sheets and pillow cases. I took them all to the laundry room. I placed the into the washing machine. I added the proper amount of liquid laundry detergent. I like the stuff that has a really strong smell. I closed the lid and let it wash. After it was done, I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet. They took an hour to dry. I removed them while they were still warm and carried them to my room. I placed the fitted sheet on, as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on. I then put the flat sheet on, the blankets on the pillow cases on and top a moment to lay on top of the fresh bedding and just smell it for a minute. That is the best smell in the world."

I also check to make sure we don't need any paper products like toilet paper or paper towel.  If I find anything that we need, it goes on the list.  Once my list is complete, I get in the car and drive to the store.  I make sure to mark off each item as I put it in the cart so I don't miss anything."

I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were many paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me. The painting had meanings or symbolism in it. She said it was like a story looking at the lady's facial expression and how her house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked the paintings better. I liked the colors of the painting."

The clothes I could not wash, that needed to be dry cleaned were put aside. I loaded the first set of clothes in to the washer, the white. I picked up the bottle of laundry soap and filled the cap up all the way. I poured the cap over the clothes in the washer. I poured a bit of bleach in as well, to make sure all the stains came out. Once they were ready, I turned the dial on the machine. I made sure it was washing on warm and the dial read \"whites\". I waited for them to finish and put the in the dryer.

When she saw me with the dropper she curled her lips and started crying. I showed her I liked the medicine and that it was tasted really yummy. Then I pretended it was a truck and it drove right into her mouth. She looked puzzled at first then she smiled and reached for more. I laughed at her and said no you will need to wait until it is time for you to take it again. Now when she sees the dropped with her medicine she smiles at me and claps. She enjoys the train dropping her medicine of in her mouth every day."

We went online and looked at our favorite airline to see what flights they had to Florida the day we wanted to leave and a flight the day wanted to come home.  We found flights we wanted and set to making our reservation.  We made sure the flights we liked had two seats available, and we got to choose where on the airplane we got to sit.  We choose two seats together in row 10, a window seat and a middle.  While the middle seat isn't as much fun as the window it meant we could sit together.  Now that we had our seats, for the way there, we then picked out seats for the way home and we were able to pick the same ones.  Now with both flights selected, we went to the payment page and paid for the seats with a credit card.  With the flights paid for, we could print out our tickets for our trip to Florida."

We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal. We tipped generously and left satisfied."

When he got to the dentist office, they were all nice to him.  He had to go sit in a dentist chair, and lean back for the lady to check his teeth.  Then she started to clean his teeth with a little machine and a little stick.  The machine made a whirring sound , but it was just water in it, and it washed his mouth out when she finished.  She then rubbed his teeth with a buffer, that made his teeth shine.  It tasted like bubble gum. He liked that part.  Then the dentist came in and examined his mouth, to make sure the lady cleaned them well. He was also checking for cavities.  Mike had no cavities that day, and the dentist was happy with Mike's clean mouth. He gave Mike a bag of things to take home, a new toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss."

I prepared all ingredients: two scrambled eggs on a bowl, one teaspoon of corn starch mixed with water, a handful of chopped green onion, one teaspoon of sesame oil, a half teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of soy sauce. I placed them in sequence of cooking order so I could just keep pouring them into the pot without messing up orders. Darn, I missed the most important item - boiling water. With water started boiling in the pot, I began putting ingredients in as plan. The soup finished good, but still seemed to be missing something. Oh, it was the white pepper power and black vinegar. It was not too late to add them in. With the final touch, it tasted much better. That was not too bad for my first soup."

I mixed up a batch of the homemade shower cleaner and sprayed it liberally my bathroom shower, which needed some serious help at the time. The homemade shower cleaner consist of  a spray bottle, 1 cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and 1 cup of vinegar and regular water. After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour. After an hour, I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower. I find it best that you have the bathroom well-ventilated when you start scrubbing because you don't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower. After I finished scrubbing away all the shower gunk I turned on the shower and let all the dirty water and cleaning agents flow into the shower drain."

We carried blankets, flashlights, hats and gloves to the car, and packed a separate bag with clothes and extra shoes.  We made sure that we had a map that would direct us to the campsite, and extra batteries for our flashlights.  We were only staying one night, but had to make sure we were prepared for cold weather and had enough food.  When the car was packed, we went to the gas station to put extra gas in our car to make sure we would have enough to get to and from the campsite the next day.  We would sleep that night, and tomorrow morning would pack our pillows, tooth brushes and toothpaste, get dressed and get in the car to drive to the campsite."

He held the picture up to the wall finding the perfect spot and marked the center of it with a pencil so he knew where the nail should go. Billy then went to his hallway closet where he had a small dresser where he kept his tools and he picked up a hammer, a nail, and a level. Billy then gently tapped the nail into the wall with the nail angled upwards a little to help hold the picture in place with his hammer being careful not to tap the nail in to the wall too far as it would\u2019ve been hard for him to pull out. He then hung the picture on the nail and used the level on the bottom of the picture so he could make sure the picture was straight on the wall. Billy then stood back and admired his new painting of a locomotive he\u2019s wanted for a long time."

When we got there the attendant took our information and asked what services we would be needing. I arranged for massages for both of us and we were given locker keys and robes. We parted ways to go into the appropriate locker rooms and change into our robes and the swimwear we brought along. After changing we had our massages, relaxing all parts of our bodies. Then we both went into a private sauna room and closed the wooden door. There was a pot of hot coals in the middle of the room and we had been instructed how to use it. I took a ladle of water from the pedestal  in the corner and poured it on the hot coals. Steam poured out of the coals and filled the warm room. Soon the sauna was filled with warm soothing steam and we both laid down together on the benches and took in the sensations. We became extremely relaxed and had forgotten about the stresses of work. Afterwards, we both changed back into our clothing and headed home for a stress-free weekend."

She was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke, and a second major stroke several weeks prior to her death left her completely incapacitated. It was a long distance to get to Wisconsin, so I flew out from New York the day before the wake. All my family was there, including my aunts, uncles, cousins, and parents. The wake was sad, but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother's life, and we talked about the good times we remembered. The following morning, we attended the funeral, where my uncle gave a eulogy, the pastor gave a sermon, and we sang some of grandma's favorite hymns. We then drove in a procession, or long line of cars, to the graveyard, where we said our final goodbyes and cried. Funerals are always sad, but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with our departed loved ones."

They look into their refrigerator, and see what they have to cook that night. Last night they picked out steak, some vegetables, and some bread to make a dinner.  They put all the food onto the counter, and started to wash the vegetables first.  Then they cut up the vegetables to make a salad.  They put the salad to the side, and made sure that they had some salad dressing in the refrigerator, so that they could use that for the salad.  They put salt, pepper and some steak sauce on the steak for seasoning.   Next, they heated up the oven, and put the steaks into the oven on high heat. It didn't take long for the steaks to cook, and then they cut up pieces of bread with butter, and put the food on plates to feed everyone."

At the store, I went through the aisles and got meat, vegetables , fruits, and so much more.  I went back home to start cooking so I could start the barbecue.  I went outside and started the grill.  I put all of the meat and vegetables on the grill to cook them.  Then all of my friends came.  The food was ready and we started to eat.  We ate the meat and the vegetables. It was really good.  Then we talked and had a lot of fun.  Then everyone left and I cleaned everything up.  Then I went back inside and finished my day."

But I could see smoke coming out the door the second I got my key out and it was so warm in the garage. I was freaking out, ran out to the car and got my cell phone. I called 911 as fast as I could. Luckily for us, the fire department is only a mile away and they were there in just 3-4 minutes. Those guys were awesome. They put out the fire so fast and ran in the house without thinking about risking their own lives or limbs. They got it out and only caused a minor amount of damage to the other rooms in the house. The kitchen will need some work but it could have been so much worse. Thank God for those firemen responding quickly after I called 911."

I needed to stop for gas otherwise I probably wouldn't make it back to my house. As I was driving, I looked for a gas station. When I found one with good, affordable gas prices, I turned in and pulled up next to a gas pump. I took my wallet out of my purse and got out of my car. I swiped my credit card at the pump and chose the type of fuel that I wanted. I put the gas pump into my car and began fueling. My gas tank was almost empty so it took awhile for my tank to fill up. The gas pump clicked off automatically when my tank was full, and I took the pump out and put it back in its place. I shut my gas cap, took my receipt, and got back in my car to drive home."

He helped her pick some of her favorite drawings, and put them in beautiful frames from the store. He had little frames and big frames, and she put in different pictures in each one.  Then her father took a painting in the frame, and a hook, and pushed the hook in the wall.  It screwed in easily, and he made sure that it was against the wall, and then he hung the frame on the hook.  He made sure that the hook was latched onto the frame on the back, and that it was hanging straight.  He hung all her frames up with all her pictures that way.  Her mom was happy to see all her art work in nice frames on the wall."

So what I did was, I went over to my local Walmart, and I bought a sponge, a pair of rubber gloves, any empty five gallon bucket, bleach and shower spray cleaner. I gathered those things and bought them all, and all cost me 9.89 in total, including tax for  these shower cleaning supplies. I headed back home, filled a bucket up with two gallons of hot water, and added two tablespoons of bleach and about a quarter cup of shower cleaner. After that I put on some rubber gloves onto my hands in order to protect them from the harsh chemicals. I then put the sponge deep into the bucket cleaning solution, and then proceeded to scrub my shower with the dousing wet sponge. I rubbed out all of the grime out of the shower with the wet, chemically treated sponge. After I completed the scrub down, it was time to rinse, so I simply ran the shower head with lukewarm water in order to drain all the grime down the shower drain. After that, my shower was finally clean, grime free and looked like new!"

My sister said that she would bring pizza and a dessert.  We prepared the salad by cutting up the lettuce and other veggies for the salad.  We put it in a bowl and took it with us as we drove to the park.  We found the place to eat and waited for my sister and brother-in-law to arrive.  After about ten minutes, they showed up with the food and the tablecloth.  We laid out the cloth and put the food on it and the plates.  We ate for the next couple of hours together there."

I went down the stairs. Then I went towards the door. I looked through the door hole to see who is at the door. It is very important to check who is outside before opening the door. What I saw through the door hole was that It was courier delivery guy. He seemed authentic. So I unlocked the door and rotated the door knob to open the door. The courier guy greeted me, and asked me to sign on a paper before receiving my courier. This is done to make sure the correct person for whom the parcel was intended only gets it. So I signed the paper, took the parcel. The courier guy smiled at me, I said bye to him and then I closed the door and locked it again."

Have a great day.\" In the stack of envelopes and news flyers, I found a letter from my sister Autumn. She was writing to me about coming to Indiana for a visit. I quickly went to my desk and pulled out a sheet of paper. Sitting down in my desk chair, I though about my school schedule for the next couple of weeks. There was no reason I would be too busy for her to come and visit the week after my next test. I dug around in the drawer for a pen, but didn't find one. There's always one in the kitchen by the phone, I thought to myself. I quickly ran in and grabbed it. Sitting back down, I wrote, \"Dear Autumn,\" at the top of the page. Telling her to come visit and the dates she could choose from, I quickly put the folded letter in an envelope, addressed it, and put a stamp on the front. I put it in the mailbox and put the little red flag up. That way the mailman would know there was a letter in there for him to pick up the next day. I was happy my sister was coming to visit soon!"

I settled on Earl Gray, which is a black tea flavored with bergamot orange. I filled the kettle with water and placed it on the stove, turning on the burner so that it would heat up and begin boiling. In the meantime, I got out a teacup and saucer, and then removed the teabag from the package and placed it into the empty cup. After a time, the water on the stove began boiling, so I removed it from the stove top and poured a cup-size amount into the teacup. It filled the cup, covering the teabag, soaking it. I removed a spoon from the drawer and placed it in the cup, stirring gently as the contents of the teabag were released and began to color the water a light brown. After some more stirring, the teabag's contents were entirely released and the tea was ready to drink."

My first task was finding a day that would work and trying to be discrete about it. This was difficult because we are both busy and also because I had to alert both of our friends to invite while making sure that none of them gave away the secret. I also had to figure out how I was going to get my girlfriend to the party without telling her that we were having a party for her. After establishing all of these details, I planned the party and sent invites, planned the food, and planned some gifts. This experience was good, but was somewhat difficult . As a the party went on, my girlfriend enjoyed it and appreciated my effort. It was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience."

So many times I forgot to get some batteries from store, and once I Had it, forgot where did I put. But finally day came, when I can do it. I got my clock, opened the place to install the batteries with screw driver. The slot was kind of rusted, but worked. Then with help of pointy side of screw driver, I clicked the old batteries out. The one I had them before took them out, now I looked for negative and positive , both on batteries and on place where I had to install them. Because if you do not install them right , it is not going to work right.  I put them in, then adjusted the time on clock, and reset the time for alarm,"

It took a lot of convincing for my husband to hang the painting. He first took out the stud finder and tape measure. He always wants it to be perfect. He found the center of the wall and the stud. He then took out his drill and drilled the screw in the wall. After the screw was in the wall and perfect, I gave him the painting to hang on the wall. Once it was up I made sure it was straight on the wall. I am very happy with the painting that I chose for my bathroom. It just goes perfectly in there and I was very happy my husband decided to hang it for me since he hates hanging pictures in the house!"

I bent down and picked up several stuffed animals and put them back in the toy box. Then I picked up puzzle pieces and put them back in the box they came in. After that, I saw that there were a lot of Legos that were left out of the Lego container. Since they are small and can be hard to see, I sat down on the rug and picked up all of the Lego pieces so I could put them away. The last thing I did was clean up a few Barbie dolls that had not been put away either. Once the playroom was clean, I went to sleep."

I opened the bottle of medicine, then picked the cup up and looked at the measuring lines to see what dose to give him. I held the cup at eye level and poured the medicine in the cup. I checked to make sure it had the right amount and placed the cup back on the counter. I replaced the lid on the medicine. I took him the medicine and told him to drink it. He drank the medicine. I took the cup when he was done and washed it out. I put the cup back on top of the medicine bottle and took the bottle back to the bathroom.

Before we go, we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops.  We make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and a ball to play with.  We walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming.  Once there, we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool.  The water feels so cold at first, but its so refreshing.  We swim around and realize we have friends there.  We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks.  We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more.  Going to the swimming pool on hot days is the best way to stay cool and have fun too."

I washed, dried and put away all of my dirty dishes, swept my kitchen floor and wiped down my counter tops and table. I also took out my garbage and put it at the end of my driveway for the garbage man to pick up. Then I moved onto my living room. I tidied up my couch and put away and miscellaneous items like books, blankets, snacks, etc. I then vacuumed my floor and dusted around my TV and bookshelf. The next room to clean was the bathroom. I used a toilet brush to scrub the inside of my toilet, and wiped down my sink and mirror. I put away any items that were left out, like toothpaste and face wash. I then used a sponge to scrub my bathtub and swept my tile floor. The last room to clean was my bedroom. I made my bed and put away my laundry. I dusted my shelves and the top of my dresser. Lastly, I vacuumed my floor. I was finally done and now had a clean flat!"

There, I went in and asked the library clerk where the daily newspapers were located.  She directed me to the third floor, where all of the periodicals and newspapers were kept.  I thanked her and went up the stairs to the third floor, seeing the newspapers held on large wooden sticks.  I found the newspaper I wanted, the New York Times, and took it over to a large empty reading table.  There, I scrolled through the pages that interested me, mainly the sports and politics sections, before returning the newspaper, exiting the library, and riding home on my bike."

At the museum, they had old giant bones of dinosaurs, wonderful movies of them, and lots of other wonderful animals there as well.  They even had lions and tiger bones, and Mikey was thrilled.  He spent all day looking at wonderful sites of nature, and how beautiful God's creation is.  He learned about conservation, and taking care of our planet.  He learned about the earth, the water and ocean, and even the skies and planets.  While he was there, they had a shop that you could buy toys and cards in.  He bought a gift for his brother and dad. One of the gifts was a dinosaur for his brother, and his dad got a world cup for coffee. His mother and him ate lunch there, and they got to see a movie of dinosaurs. They had a wonderful time."

She asked me to make her some coffee too!  I had to grind up some more beans.  I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container.  I put the container into our microwave, which was three years old!  I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave is not that fast.  I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for my wife.  I filled the filter up with the coffee I had ground.  I tamped down the coffee grounds with my hand.  Then I carefully poured the hot water from the microwave over the coffee grounds.  I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the grounds to come to rest in the filter.  Then I slowly poured more of the water into the grounds.  I gave my wife her cup of coffee when the water was done draining."

About once a month, however, my wife and I get bored and decide to do something we've been doing together since we met 50 long years ago. I dress up in one of my nicer suits and she puts on a dress in which she looks absolutely beautiful. We belong to a club that holds dance lessons every week so we sign up in advance and make our way there. Once we arrive we greet all of our old friends and get a short lesson on what we're to be learning that evening. Then, for about an hour or so, my wife and I dance with each other and some of our friends. We try to keep up with all the steps, but our old joints soon make us aware of our age. Even still, I would never give up the opportunity to dance."

We purchased a tent that was big enough for all of us and enough sleeping bags to sleep us all. We took some cast iron skillets from the kitchen, so we could cook with them. We also bought enough food. We bought food that would not go bad if it was not in a fridge. We bought lots of canned food. We also bought bottled water, enough to last the whole trip. We paced the clothes we would wear. We also packed all our gear. When we were sure we were ready, we headed out to the woods to go camping."

This is the case for me and my cat. Just this morning, the first thing I did after waking up was feed him. The cat usually always has a way to tell me that he's hungry. If he doesn't jump onto my bead and brush up against my head, he'll meow very loudly while standing next to the pantry, where I keep the cans of food. Once I see that he's hungry and trying to tell me, I go over to the pantry and grab a can of cat food. I use a can opener to crack it open, and then I pour it into his bowl. I'll then watch him as he eats. He never leaves a single piece of food in his bowl, and always licks it clean."

I set my luggage aside and settled into my seat . The steward came over and asked if I wanted a beverage . I said I would like a water . She quickly returned with my drink . Shortly after , the train departed . I was impressed with the scenery during the trip . I also chatted with a few other passengers and enjoyed a quick nap during the trip .

I pushed the mower into the yard where I normally started to mow. I cranked to mower, and on the third try it started. I pushed the mower back and forth throughout my yard, creating straight and conformed lines. Once I had completely mowed the front of my yard, I turned the mower off and took long drinks of my water. I then pushed the mower to the backyard and started it up again. Making straight lines in the grass, I completed the backyard, as well. As I turned my mower off, a neighbor who was passing by waved and gave me a smile. I smiled back and continued to clean up and put my mower away."

I called the salon and made an appointment for the next day . Upon arriving , I was greeted by a very nice hair stylist . She had me sit in the chair and asked me how I wanted my hair cut . I told her exactly what I wanted and she understood completely . She went to work immediately , we made small talk . She was very friendly . After she cut my hair , she washed it . After drying my hair , she added a little wax to style the hair . I was very happy with the haircut . I then paid and gave her a tip for her service . "

I have a lot of throw rugs and pick them up first before cleaning the floor. I fold the rugs so that any dirt in them does not get on the floor. I like to sweep. I sweep all around the floor and even along the wall and corners of the room very well. I saw a spill mark in the kitchen and got a damp paper towel to clean up the mark. It took some scrubbing but finally came off the floor. I went outside to shack out my throw rugs. It was a nice day outside. I vacuumed my big rugs. Some of my floor needed to be mopped, so I did that and let the floors dry. I will try not to get the floors dirty."

We waiting until opening day, and went down that night to buy our tickets to watch the show.  We waited in line for several minutes before we were able to pay for our tickets.  Once we had our tickets we got in line to buy some snacks.  I ordered a large popcorn with extra butter and a large Coke.  Steve ordered a medium popcorn with butter, some peanut M&Ms and a large Dr. Pepper.  Once we had our snacks we handed over our tickets to the usher and walked into the theater.  We carefully scouted for just the right seats.  When we found the perfect seats, we sat down and watched the movie previews to see what new movies would soon be coming out.  Once the previews were over, the theater darkened and the movie began."

I walked to the kitchen and got out all of the ingredient I needed, which included, eggs, bacon, cheese, onion, and green pepper. I placed a skillet on the burner to heat up, and cracked two eggs into a bowl. I threw away the shells and stirred them up until mixed. I also put the bacon in the frying pan and flipped each piece after several minutes. Once the bacon was cooked, I poured the veggies and egg mixture into the pan, stirring occasionally, until the mixture set up and was solid. Once cooked, I removed the eggs and placed them on a plate along with the bacon. I put the plate on the table and poured out a glass of orange juice to go with my meal. I also peeled an orange and set it on the plate. It was delicious!"

I walk into the store and the way it is laid out I can easily find the items that I need pretty quickly , grocery shopping is not my favorite past time , I go to the deli counter and get lunch meat for help yourself nights and school lunches . I then head to the meat department to get some chicken and a roast for Sunday . Now time for the isles and my coupon matches , I head down each isle relativity quickly since I already know pretty much what I am going to buy and how much of it I need . I finish each isle and have all of my necessities . I go over to the bakery to see what they have on sale today and see a large carrot roll with cream cheese filling . So I place that in my cart and head for the checkout isle . I place all my purchases on the belt near the cashier and watch as each one is scanned , She totals my purchase and I pay for them . As I leave the store I look at my watch and realize it took me much less time as usual . Now I can enjoy the rest of my day ! "

In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved."
