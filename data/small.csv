Last week , my girlfriend and I decided to renovate our basement . We wanted to make it look new and fresh . First , we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures , deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room . We then made a list of things we needed to buy at the store to accomplish this renovation . We came back home and began working in the basement . We worked together and removed certain things first . Then , we painted the basement walls together . Then , we hung pictures on the walls that we 'd bought . We then placed a few items like a couch and large TV that we 'd bought in the basement . We added our new carpets too . Finally , we put the popcorn machine in the corner of the basement and our basement looked new and fresh ! Our basement had been nicely renovated indeed !|Where did they go with the list?|The supermarket.|0

The sharp buzz of the washing machine timer distracted me from the television show flickering on the screen . I thought about ignoring it , but I had an early shift at the diner the next morning and my only pair of black pants were in the laundry load . I went down the steep stairs to the basement where the laundry room sat , out of the way . I opened the washer and sighed as I looked inside . I grabbed an armful of the clothes from the washer and tossed them into the dryer , than repeated the process until the washer was empty . Without much thought , I tossed in a dryer sheet and slammed the door . I checked the settings , adjusted a few , and heard the comforting hum of the dryer coming to life . Satisfied that I would be ready for work the next day , I returned up the stairs to my television show .|Where were the pants?|in the laundry load|1

I wanted to take a photograph of something natural . So I decided to go out side and see what I could take a picture of . After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later .|When did they decide whether or not to use the Flash?|After getting the whole tree in the picture|0

After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later .|What did they use if it was dark?|photo|0

After I finished university , I wanted to move out on my own . I waited a while and lived with my parents for a few months . I was n't too happy with that situation though because I wanted freedom , I wanted to be able to meet people , go out at night , lay on the couch and watch TV all day if that 's what I felt like doing .  I started dating my boyfriend and we had been together for almost six months when we made the decision to move in together .  All the apartments we saw were either terrible or beautiful but incredibly expensive . Eventually we found what that was beautiful , spacious and looked perfect for us and it was priced very well . So we took the leap and we decided to buy the flat .|What did they make?|a decision to move in together|1

Sometimes I really hate visiting the doctor . But at the same time I feel good because if anything is wrong with me the doctor will be able to help . When I think I 'm either sick or just to make sure I 'm healthy I make a doctor appointment . When it 's 20 minutes before it 's time for my appointment , I leave my house to go . Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park . I walk inside the doctor 's office and check in with the receptionist . Once they call my name I go straight to the scale to get weighed , I always hate this part . Then the nurse takes me to the room , takes my blood pressure and asks why I 'm there . I 'm only there to check my cholesterol since last time I had it checked it was high . The doctor then comes in to talk about my last results and says that we will check it again today and then call him back in 3 months if it 's high to talk about my options . After that is done I go to the check out window and pay my copay for my visit .|Where do they get blood drawn?|at the doctor's office|1

First I turned on the computer to insert my hard-drive into . I then connected the projector so that I could screen my presentation to my colleagues . Once I had the computer and projector up and running I pulled down the screen in which the projector would be projecting onto . I took two deep breaths and performed a quick practice run in my mind while double checking that all of my equipment was up to par and ready for my big presentation . I also handed out paper copies of my presentation to my colleagues so they could be familiar with it if need be for future references . Once I got all I needed passed out for my presentation , it was showtime and I felt 110 percent ready to tackle my presentation .|What did they need to follow along with?|colleagues|0

Our regular piano player was out sick and could n't play piano for the Sunday service . Another member of our church remembered that I use to play piano , and asked if I would be interested in filling in . I was really nervous . It had been a long time since I have played in front of people and I was n't sure if I knew the songs well . They gave me the music ahead of time and I went home and practiced . I spent a lot of time learning the new songs . Finally it was Sunday and I was really nervous . I was n't sure I would know when to start playing or if I would remember the right keys . I was n't nervous anymore and just started playing . I really enjoyed myself . Afterwards everyone was telling me I did a good job and the Pastor asked if I would be interested filling in again if they needed someone .|When did service start?|Sunday|1

Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring .

Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights .

When I cooked pasta last , I had a great experience . I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce . In order to do this , we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box . As we put the pasta in , we stirred it and watched the water boil . After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes , we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat . Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste , we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot . Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot , we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta .|When did the pasta taste amazing?|During the last time they cooked pasta|1
