I secured the bag at the top with the ties that came with the bag and I set it aside on the floor.   I went to the kitchen cabinet, opened it and took a new garbage bag out of the box.  I closed the cabinet door.  Then I went back to the empty wastebasket.  I fluffed out the new garbage bag so that it would fill properly.   I inserted it into the empty container and secure it with clips on all sides at the top.   Then I took the full garbage bag out to the car to carry to the town dumpsters."

There, I went in and asked the library clerk where the daily newspapers were located.  She directed me to the third floor, where all of the periodicals and newspapers were kept.  I thanked her and went up the stairs to the third floor, seeing the newspapers held on large wooden sticks.  I found the newspaper I wanted, the New York Times, and took it over to a large empty reading table.  There, I scrolled through the pages that interested me, mainly the sports and politics sections, before returning the newspaper, exiting the library, and riding home on my bike."

At the museum, they had old giant bones of dinosaurs, wonderful movies of them, and lots of other wonderful animals there as well.  They even had lions and tiger bones, and Mikey was thrilled.  He spent all day looking at wonderful sites of nature, and how beautiful God's creation is.  He learned about conservation, and taking care of our planet.  He learned about the earth, the water and ocean, and even the skies and planets.  While he was there, they had a shop that you could buy toys and cards in.  He bought a gift for his brother and dad. One of the gifts was a dinosaur for his brother, and his dad got a world cup for coffee. His mother and him ate lunch there, and they got to see a movie of dinosaurs. They had a wonderful time."

She asked me to make her some coffee too!  I had to grind up some more beans.  I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container.  I put the container into our microwave, which was three years old!  I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave is not that fast.  I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for my wife.  I filled the filter up with the coffee I had ground.  I tamped down the coffee grounds with my hand.  Then I carefully poured the hot water from the microwave over the coffee grounds.  I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the grounds to come to rest in the filter.  Then I slowly poured more of the water into the grounds.  I gave my wife her cup of coffee when the water was done draining."
