First , we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures , deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room . We then made a list of things we needed to buy at the store to accomplish this renovation . We came back home and began working in the basement . We worked together and removed certain things first . Then , we painted the basement walls together . Then , we hung pictures on the walls that we 'd bought . We then placed a few items like a couch and large TV that we 'd bought in the basement . We added our new carpets too . Finally , we put the popcorn machine in the corner of the basement and our basement looked new and fresh ! Our basement had been nicely renovated indeed !"

I went down the steep stairs to the basement where the laundry room sat , out of the way . I opened the washer and sighed as I looked inside . I grabbed an armful of the clothes from the washer and tossed them into the dryer , than repeated the process until the washer was empty . Without much thought , I tossed in a dryer sheet and slammed the door . I checked the settings , adjusted a few , and heard the comforting hum of the dryer coming to life . Satisfied that I would be ready for work the next day , I returned up the stairs to my television show ."

I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later ."

Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park . I walk inside the doctor 's office and check in with the receptionist . Once they call my name I go straight to the scale to get weighed , I always hate this part . Then the nurse takes me to the room , takes my blood pressure and asks why I 'm there . I 'm only there to check my cholesterol since last time I had it checked it was high . The doctor then comes in to talk about my last results and says that we will check it again today and then call him back in 3 months if it 's high to talk about my options . After that is done I go to the check out window and pay my copay for my visit ."

I spent a lot of time learning the new songs . Finally it was Sunday and I was really nervous . I was n't sure I would know when to start playing or if I would remember the right keys . I was n't nervous anymore and just started playing . I really enjoyed myself .

And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring .

In order to do this , we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box . As we put the pasta in , we stirred it and watched the water boil . After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes , we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat . Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste , we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot . Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot , we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta ."

It was a short walk through the neighborhood and we passed many of our friends and neighbors on the way .  Mr. Jones , the mail carrier , said \" Good morning . Have a great first day ! \" When we arrived across the street from the school , Mrs. Green , the Crossing Guard , said \" Wait here please . \"  She walked out into the street and held up her \" STOP \" sign to make it safe for us to cross .

The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out . I pulled open the top of the bag and shook it out to make it expand . I slid it down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure it did n't slip down in the can .

When I was all ready , I went back to the shelter and asked to adopt the dog . After I received all of the proper paperwork , I jumped back in the car with my new friend and drove home .

The last visit , I went in and said `` hello '' to the receptionist . She checked me in and said the hygienist would be with me shortly . The hygienist is the person you see first , who cleans your teeth with a scraper , flosses them , and sometimes treats them with a pasty substance called fluoride . He said I had one small cavity , which I normally do n't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months . A cavity can be a little scary , since the dentist goes in with a drill . I was scared it would hurt , but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in my mouth and injected something called Novocaine . Afterwards , I talked funny for a little while , but had healthy and clean teeth again ."

I turn it on and let it start filling with water . I wait until the entire bottom is filled with water then I pour in the proper amount of detergent . Only then do I start loading in the clothes . I usually do it one article of clothing at a time , moving around the drum so the load stays balanced . Once it 's full , I simply close the door and let it run . When it stops , you take the clothes out and move them to the dryer ."

She soon began to speak to another little girl names Eva and they were soon taking turns pushing each other on the swing . The two friends then decided to get in line for the slide . Kathy went first because she is a little more daring and her friend . Eva had never been on the tallest slide at the playground before but when she saw Kathy go down without a problem , she felt brave too . After a while , Kathy and Eva got tired of climbing up the slide so they went off to the moneky bars . When it was time to go the new friends gave each other a hug and promised to see each other at the playground on the next sunny day ."

I turned on my stove , put the nonstick pan on and turned stove on medium heat . Meanwhile I got some cheese and salsa out for extra flavor . When the pan was hot enough , I added 2 tablespoon of unsalted butter -LRB- I love butter -RRB- , and then I did not wait it to be hot , but immediately poured my eggs into pan . In a minute , I started to stir my eggs , added some cheese and salsa , salt and some pepper . I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked . When all moisture disappeared , I moved pan from stove , transferred it to plate ."

When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price . I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store . I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for , I will put that on the other side of the paper .

Folding clothes makes them easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers . If you are going to iron the clothes later , they are less rumpled if you have folded them first . I put them in piles according to clothing type . The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes . I smooth out my socks and put them in pairs , tucking them together at the tops so they stay together . First I lay the item on the bed , smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat , then I fold it into one or two parts . Men 's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage . This is still folding them , as it minimizes the wrinkles . I fold T-shirt , after smoothing them out , by folding the sleeves in first , then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters . Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them . I do n't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes , as my husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear . After I am done folding the clothes I put them away on a shelf in the closet or in drawers ."

After the tub I sprayed the same solution into the toilet and scrubbed the toilet with the scrubbing brush . I then scrubbed the sink and the faucet until they were shining . Next I sprayed the mirror with Windex and cleaned that until it was as clear as could be . I used my swifter wet jet and sprayed the solution and scrubbed the floor until it was completely clean . Once one bathroom is done I do the exact same process to the second bathroom ."

When I went to the doctor , they asked me if I was going to have to pay for the visit . I told them that I did , because of my insurance , and so I paid a little bit of money . After a few minutes , my name was called and I visited with my doctor . He stuck a popsicle stick down my throat to see if everything was fine . He said it looked good , so I must be coughing because I 'm a little too thirsty . He also sent me home to get some rest there ."

I peeled away the plastic paper on the back of the tape and attached it to the poster around the outside . Then I peeled away the plastic paper on the other side of the tape . I carried the poster to the wall and took the top two corners of the poster , and placed those where I wanted them to be and pushed them down , making sure the top of the poster looked straight . After this I pressed down the sides of the posters also where the double-sided tape was , and kept the poster tight at the same time . Then I pressed down along the bottom of the poster as well ."

I selected a nice mild basmati rice to cook for dinner . I took out the container and looked at the instructions . I poured two cups of water into the pot and added one cup of rice . I let it soak for 15 minutes , and then I turned on the burner . Once the water started boiling , I covered the pot and reduced the temperature to simmer for ten minutes . I let the rice sit covered for five minutes , and then I fluffed it with a fork . I put it in a bowl to enjoy ."

Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market . When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up . When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones . Some of the fish he buys still has the head , fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too . I like it better when he leaves the scales -LRB- skin -RRB- of the fish as it tastes really good . There are many different ways that he cooks the fish . Sometimes he will fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it . My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi . In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it . My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain ."

She was up against Sloan Stewart . We found our seats and got comfortable . The crowd jumped to its feet when the two players walked out holding their raquets . Within a few minutes , Sloan served the ball and Venus easily returned it . So it was tied up in the third . Both players were sweating but they looked like they still had energy . Venus took the first two games and dominated the court . My friend and I were so excited to have gotten to see such an exciting tennis match !"

After grabbing towels and bathrobes in exchange for the soggy rags our clothes had become I carried the garments , sopping with water , into the laundry room to dry them in the clothes dryer . First I had to set the temperature of the dryer . A medium temperature seemed like the best idea there . Then I had to choose how long to dry them . Thirty minutes ? Sixty minutes ? With no clue how long it would take I set the timer dial to automatic , surely the dryer would know more about how much time it would take than I would . With everything attended to I closed the door , pressed the start button and we watched through the little circular window as the clothes tumbled around in the machine . After about forty five minutes the buzzer on the dryer sounded and the machine shut itself off . I opened the door to a gust of hot air and lavender scent . One by one I pulled the dry articles of clothing out of the appliance and we put our pants and shirts and socks all back on . A fun night in all , if I do say so myself ."

Before opening my driver side door , I quickly grabbed my bank card and pushed the fuel door button that was located near the bottom of my seat . I looked at the pump and inserted my payment card in the payment slot and then selected the type of gas that my car uses . I then opened the fuel door , took the gas nozzle from the pump and inserted it into the gas tank . The handle had a jumping sensation as an indication that my tank was full and the job was finished . I removed the nozzle from the tank and placed it back on the pump , took my receipt , jumped in my car and headed off to work"

I waited , and after a few minutes , a medical assistant called my name so I went with her into the exam room . The assistant measured my height , weight , temperature , heart rate , and blood pressure , and I responded to her questions about why I was there and what medications I take . After inputting the data into a computer she left and I waited in the exam room until the doctor arrived . The doctor then looked into my eyes , ears , and throat with a bright light and felt my glands on my throat and neck . The doctor listened to my heart and my breathing through a stethoscope . After looking at data in the computer , the doctor said that I did not need a prescription , and that I should treat my sore throat with rest , lots of liquids , and an over-the-counter pain and fever reliever . After that , both the doctor and I left the exam room , and I went home and followed the doctor 's advice to rest , drink liquids , and take an over-the-counter pain killer/fever reliever ."

We would start things off with an actual game of bowling . We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes , followed by getting our lane .

I read it a little while waiting for the service to begin . The pastor then went to the front of the church and thanked everyone for coming . He asked us to turn to a certain page of our Bibles to read a verse with him , so I turned to the page and read along . I listened intently and felt very moved by his words . When the service was over , I thanked him for his work and went home ."

Safety was important in a contact sport like football , so we had to put on our uniforms and all of our protective padding . He gave us a pep talk and reminded us how we were supposed to play the first quarter , what plays and strategies we were supposed to use . Then we put our hands in the circle , cheered for ourselves , and started the game . We followed our coach 's playbook , throwing the ball , running defense , tackling the guys on the other team . Sometimes we scored a touchdown and sometimes we did n't . Our team had practiced every day , though , and we knew what we were doing . Our coach kept up the pep talks and advice through each quarter of the game as we swapped out tired players for new ones and kept running across the field and scoring goals . It was a great football game !"

Upon tying the bag , I took it outside and placed it on the front lawn , where the trash people always pick it up . I then pushed the new trash bag down so that I knew that I could fit any new trash into the bag and I then stopped .

I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part !"

First we did some freestyle , and after a few minutes it transformed into a funny \" dog style \" , just paddling with our arms and legs like dogs do when they swim . When the instructor came , he greeted the children . All of them stood on one edge of the pool when I swam to the side just to give all of them space to train . He made a circle with his arms and told the children to jump through it head first into the water , with arms stretching forward and touching each other . He made all children repeat the diving until he thought everyone got it decently right , since there was age variety among the 12 students , ages 5 to 15 . The diving practice took some 15 minutes . I told him I only knew butterfly stroke from Wikipedia so I would be more than happy to give it a try . He gave me some instructions about how to make the stroke better , and it took another 45 minutes to help the children practice theirs . After one hour had passed , we got out of the pool , the teacher said goodbye to everyone and we all gave him our payment for the hour of class ."

He did a really great job on the painting and he was very proud of his master piece . He and I walked around the house with the painting and looked for the perfect spot . We looked in the living room , the kitchen , the playroom , and even the bathroom . We finally decided it would look best in my bedroom . That way I could always see it and it would be with me . We took the painting , a nail , a hammer and a tape measure and headed into my room to hang it up . I put the nail in a little and let my little boy hammer it is , too . We hung the painting on the nail and it was the perfect touch that my room needed ."

I allowed this to stay on the walls about five minutes . Then I took a wet sponge and began rubbing the tub and shower walls with a circular motion . I used this to wash off all the soap from the walls . I checked to make sure I did n't miss any spots . I placed the shampoo , soap , and razors back into their spots .

It 's a great way to motivate myself to stay at the gym ! I like to lift weights one day a week , and the other two days is dedicated entirely to cardio .

After I spent hours cleaning out nests I found inside my couches , I gave up and decided having a cat would be fare less work than dealing with this mess and hopefully might help with the mice issue .

I can also make them to fit me perfectly . I decided to make a dress . When I got home , I opened the pattern and spread out all the pattern pages . Each page has patterns for different pieces of the dress in different sizes . They are all printed over each other . I looked on the instructions to work out which size I wanted to make the dress , and found which color of line I needed to cut along . I cut out all the pieces . There was a front and a back piece , a sleeve pattern , which I needed to cut two of , and a collar . Then I cut around the paper pattern and through the fabric to get the fabric pieces the right shape . Then I pinned the pieces together with the front of the fabric on the inside . I sewed along each edge with my sewing machine . Then I sewed the sleeve seam , and then sewed the sleeve to the dress . Finally I sewed the collar to the neckline of the dress . All of that was done with the inside of the fabric facing out , so the seams would end up on the inside when I turned it right-side out . So finally I turned it right side out , all the seams ended up on the inside , and I had a new dress to wear ."

The weather was nice and sunny outside , so we decided it would be the perfect day to spend time outdoors in our backyard garden . Our garden has a lot of flowers in it , but we thought it would be fun to plant some vegetables as well . We went to the store and picked up some supplies that we would need , like a small shovel , a small watering can , and some vegetable seeds -LRB- including carrot seeds , tomato seeds , and cucumber seeds -RRB- . We then went to our backyard and started to dig small holes in the soil so that we would have space to plant our seeds . Then we filled the watering can and watered each small mound of soil that had seeds underneath . All in all , working in the garden was a great way to spend the afternoon ."

The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle .  To play tennis , we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets .  If you do n't hit the ball back when it 's hit to you , or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court , you score points .  When you score once , you get fifteen points . When you score again , you get another fifteen points , so you have 30 points . Score a third time , you get 10 points , giving you a total of 40 ."

Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people , sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs . There is a low net between both people playing the game . Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores . The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set . We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired , then we came home . It was really a good workout for the both of us and we would like to take you to watch and play the next time we decide to play tennis ."

When I arrived the place was rather full with customers , seemingly more woman than men . Several people were covered with the big hair drying bag over their head which makes me giggle . I was told to go right in the back where the men 's area is located and sat down for my hair cut . After having my hair washed by a helper I was soon seated at Sue 's chair and enjoyed our usual small talk while she cut my hair .

Unfortunately , I had removed the bed sheets from the bed to launder them . I had taken off the fitted sheet and the pillowcases and tossed them into the washer . So , I went to my closet and took out another bed sheet and pillow case set . I unfurled the fitted sheet and managed to get it around all four corners . I then took the pillowcases and put them on my two pillows . After finishing the bed sheet change , I passed out on my soft , comfortable , and now , clean bed for a night of sleep . Tomorrow morning , I will take out the drying sheets and pillowcase from the dryer , fold them and then put them in the closet that I got tonight 's new sheets from . Sleepy time ."

Once everyone had their tickets , a guide met us and led the group through the museum . I saw lots of exhibits : paintings , sculptures , pottery , and more . There was so much to see in the museum . Even if I 'd stayed all day , there was no way I could have seen all of it . At the end of my trip , I went to the souvenir store and bought myself a few trinkets . It was great !"

In my house , taking out the garbage is one of my son 's , Matthew , duties . Matthew first collects garbage from the garbage cans in all the rooms around the house ; the kitchen , bathrooms and bedrooms . As Matthew collects garbage from all the rooms , he also changes all the garbage bags that are used in the garbage cans . He then takes the big garbage bag and goes outside the house to put the bag full of garbage into the big outside garbage can . Finally , Matthew puts the big outside garbage can on the curve so that the garbage man will empty it into the garbage truck and haul it away to the landfill . Matthew takes out the garbage every Sunday and Wednesday since this is one of his assigned chores ."

My parking pass was already hanging from my rear-view mirror , showing that I was allowed to park in the building 's parking lot . I went into the break room and put my lunch in the refrigerator . Several people I work with said good morning , and I greeted them in return . Then I sat down at my desk and opened my email to see what I needed to do today ."

I choose to pay more today to purchase the leaner package of meat to make a healthier meal for myself . I picked a large heavy frying pan from my cabinet and put it on the front stove burner . I turned the heat knob to medium high and placed the raw patties in the pan to cook . After about seven minutes , I used a spatula to pick up a patty and check the underside . It appeared to be browned on the bottom so I flipped the patties over to cook on the other side . I used a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat . It read 165 so I knew my dinner was safe to eat . I set the table with buns , ketchup , mustard and pickles and sat down to eat a delicious hamburger ."

I took out the correct number of pills and went to the kitchen to get her a glass of water .

My mom decided to order a pizza because it was something we could grab and eat on the way . First , she asked us whether we 'd like pizza from Pizza Hut , Papa John 's or Domino 's . We picked Pizza Hut . The worker asked what we would like . Mom ordered two large pizzas : one plain cheese and one pepperoni . Then she was asked if we 'd like any drinks or breadsticks to go with it . Then we were told our order would be delivered in about 30 to 45 minutes . Mom hung up and told us to get ready to go . 30 minutes later , the pizza delivery person knocked on the door . She gave the driver $ 3 to keep for himself for delivering the pizza for us . The pizzas were delicious !"

He put a worm at the end of my fishing hook and then told me to cast my fishing line into the lake . Once my fishing line was in the lake I waited and waited , but it seemed like there were no fish that were falling for my bait . I began reeling it in to find a fish that was 12 inches long ! My dad and I took it home so that mom could cook it for dinner ."

They said that they could do that , but it would be a 10 minute wait . I told them that was fine and we waited for everyone to show up . After 10 minutes , a waiter took us back into the other room in order to enjoy a nice table . They sat us down and we waited until everyone was seated until we started to order drinks and any food that we were already hungry to start eating ."

My friend lives in Arizona and I live in Mississippi , so I had to mail it . I addressed the envelope and put a stamp on it . I washed the smudges from my hand and carried the letter to my mailbox so the mailman could pick it up the next day ."

The city is very busy , and parking can be hard to find , so it is often easier to take a taxi to get to place to place . We had decided to go to dinner and see a play . We walked to a street where taxis often go past , and waved to show the driver that we wanted a ride . I told the driver the name and address of the Thai restaurant my friend and I had planned to go to . He was familiar with the location and we started to travel . On he way , the driver told us that he also enjoyed Thai food and recommended the green curry at that restaurant . As we were driving , I could see how much the cost of the trip would be as a screen displayed a slowly increasing cost . We got to our destination , and I paid the driver the fee on the screen along with a small tip ."

We had to wait in line for a little while because a lot of people were going to the game . When we got to the front of the line , we handed our tickets to someone and they let us in . I ordered a hot dog , some nachos and a Sprite . My dad had popcorn , a hamburger and a Coke . We were cheering for the Buckeyes to win . At halftime , we went to the bathroom . The lines were really long , so we did n't get to hear the band play . Even though we cheered for the Buckeyes , they still lost . After the game was over , we went home . I had a lot of fun ."

It is said if dogs have a confined space they will not go to the bathroom since it will soil their immediate surroundings . The next three commands we taught Sunny were to sit , shake , and stay . He was a quick learner . Treats helped immensely for training the dog to follow these commands ."

I can control the temperature and it is safer than microwaving for the baby . After testing a drop or two of warmed formula on my wrist , to make sure it is n't too cold or hot , it is time to pick up the baby and feed them . I hold the baby in my arms as they longingly look into my eyes . After about fifteen minutes the baby is n't drinking anymore . I put them over my shoulder and rub their back in order for them to burp . I then prop them up in their baby seat so as not to choke ."

I scored the first six points of the game this way , and the play was very easy . The next time we tried to use this same play , it was n't so easy . The other team caught on to what we were trying to do and actually got the ball from us and scored 6 points ! We then pushed them back so that we could score another 6 points with a touchdown , and our kicker got us an extra 2 points . I love playing football because it gives me a chance to hang out with my friends and be active at the same time . We are all very good at football !"

This is the easiest way to do it though , I could have hand washed them and hung them up to dry but I bet that takes even longer . Who wants to be dressed in dirty clothes after all ?

It is much easier to feed baby in car seat , because you can rock it at same time to sooth them too . I put the bib around her neck , and i made sure it is big enough , because it always make mass , I grabbed baby food which I purchased from grocery store . It was peach and banana . She smiled , I was happy that she liked it , because first time i introduced her this flavor . I opened another bottle , that is zucchini and peas . Alternatively I gave that too , just to give more change of taste . I gave her water time to time . She calmed down very quickly and finished her food ,"

I even bought a special vacuum that specializes in vacuuming carpets to look like they are new . When I get to the vacuuming part of my cleaning routine , I take out my vacuum and plug it into the wall .  Then I take the vacuum to my carpet and start to vacuum all the area ; making sure to not leave any spot .  I like clean lines and the fresh look vacuuming leaves my carpet so I make sure no to step over what I freshly vacuumed .

Then , I began to cook the chicken . Chicken Marsala is also served with pasta noodles , so after a while I boiled the pasta so that it would be ready by the time the chicken was . Once both items were ready , I put them onto plates and carried the plates over to the dinner table where my friends were sitting .

She made me do most of the work though , telling me that she was so proud of me . I know that I would n't be qualified for anything more than that so I was being realistic . After scanning the listings for entry level positions , I saw one that sounded really good . It was an interesting company and they wanted someone who had the skills that I have . I sent my resume online , as they asked , and hoped for a call to set up a time for my interview . I was very nervous . A day or two went by and I keep sending resumes to different places . On the third day I got a text message asking me to call the first company I sent my resume to . A very nice man answered . I told him I was calling in response to his email to set up an appointment for an interview . He said he was looking forward to meeting me and asked if tomorrow was convenient for me . I was so excited , but I stayed calm and told him that , thank you , it would be very convenient . He was very nice and spoke with me for quite a while . At the end of our meeting he told me he did n't have to look any further , I was hired . I could n't believe it . I felt so happy and lucky at the same time . I had my first job !"

I use box mixes . it really does n't take much time . All you need to do is get one bowl . Add the cake mix from the box . Then a half cup of oil and finally about a cup of water . Then you need to get your mixer and put it on medium and mix it all up for 2 to 3 minutes . Then put it into a non stick cake pan and bake for about 30 minutes . So all together about 10 minutes preparation and 30 minutes baking you can have a good tasting cake in 40 minutes . ."

After a while , he started obeying the command even without getting a treat in return . Over the next few days , I trained my dog to respond to different commands by gradually working up to more complicated commands like lay down , fetch , and retrieve . Training my dog took lots of patience on my part , and lots of hard work from my dog , but it was worth it ."

At the same store I get the thread to match my fabric and if I need buttons or zippers , they are in the same store , too . The patterns are made of folded paper so when i get ready to start , i spread the fabric out in a big area near my sewing machine and place the paper patterns on top and pin them together . After all of the pieces are cut and i put my new thread in my sewing machine , I can start sewing the pieces of my costume together ."

I put all of my toiletries like shampoo , sunscreen and toothbrush into a plastic bag in case they would leak and into a special toiletry bag and put that in the top of the suitcase .

After washing the meat with clean water I lit the stove and put clean pot on it and I pour clean water inside . I cut some onion inside the empty pot add some other ingredient in the pot and pour the meat inside before adding salt . After like 15 minutes , I opened the pot , the meat has already been boiled when I tasted it I realized it now really so soft and good to eat but since I do n\u2019t want my mum to punish me I only eat some just some part of the meat . I put frying pan on fire . Added some oil after some time when I realized the oil was very hot I decided to put the meat on fire . The colour of the meat changed to dark brown as it fries I really enjoyed looking at it been fried and the noise it was making ."

Some of the movies you could only buy and they were n't even available to rent . It was hard for me to decide between the movies that were available , so I watched free previews for a couple of the movies . I pushed the button that said `` rent '' and I confirmed that I wanted to rent it . A message on the screen said I had access to the movie for the next 24 hours . I watched the movie right then , and it was pretty good ."

After I put away my dishes , and wiped down the counters , I wanted to make sure the floor was nice and clean .  First , I got out my broom and dust pan .  I moved all of the furniture out of the way and carefully swept up any debris or dirt off of the linoleum floor .  Then , I got out my bucket and filled it with hot water and soap . I then went into the storage closet and grabbed my mop . I put the mop in the bucket of water and got it nice and wet .  Afterwards , I let the floor dry and put all of the chairs and things I had previously moved back into their rightful spots ."

The only thing I had to do was cook the meat . Once the saucepan was very hot , I put just enough meat in it to make a hearty hamburger . The meat started to sizzle as it cooked . After a few minutes , I knew it was time to flip it over and cook the other side . I used a spatula to flip it over . The side that was already cooked looked perfect ! After a few more minutes of sizzling , I knew that the second side was done as well and that my hamburger was ready to eat . Before I started eating , I made sure to turn off the stove ."

I was only seated for a few minutes when the hairdresser said that she was ready for me . She led me over to a chair and I sat down . We discussed what I wanted to do with my hair , a trim , and then she took me to the shampoo area . She combed my hair out and then cut off the split ends a few small sections at a time . I saw little wisps of my hair fall onto the floor . When the hairdresser was finished cutting , she took out a blow dryer and dried my hair . I walked back over to the receptionist and paid for the cut . I added about twenty percent as a tip to reward the hairdresser for doing a great job . I left the hair salon and drove home ."

There is a tennis court outside of our apartment clubhouse , so we decided to rent some tennis racquets and balls from our clubhouse . We first met up at the clubhouse to pick up the racquets and balls . I changed into a tennis skirt and put on some tennis shoes . My friend changed into athletic clothes as well and put on a tennis visor . We then went to the tennis court with our gear . We volleyed the ball back and forth for a while , and I felt proud that my tennis skills had n't gotten rusty . After we 'd played for an hour , a couple joined us and asked if we wanted to play doubles . We ended up playing for another two hours !"

I always begin by surveying my refrigerator and cabinets .  What food do I already have and what do I need ?  At this point I begin to make a written list to bring with . This week I also had a birthday party to shop for so extras like cake mix and a can of frosting went on my list . Once the list was done I headed to the store .  It 's a short drive , and once there I grabbed a cart and begin to head down the aisles .  After that on to dairy and dried goods , and even cleaning products . Finally it was off to the frozen aisles , I needed to get ice cream for the party ! With a full cart I went to the cash register , loaded all the food on the convener belt , and then paid for the groceries as a boy bagged everything .  Another Saturday 's chore was done !"

Finally the game came down to one last move , If I got a strike we would win and if I did n't we would lose and surprisingly I was able to get the strike and get my team the win !"

The church is very close to my house so I was able to sleep in a little bit before I had to leave . When I got to the church , my first thought was about how small the building was , but when I went inside I could see that it was much bigger than it appeared .  When the service started , I got a little nervous , because this church is different from the church I usually attend . I did not know the prayers , hymns , and did not know when to sit , kneel and stand . It did not matter .  People around me were very helpful , and I figured out that if I watched the people around the altar , I could figure out what I needed to do .  I loved all of the ceremony and the formality of the service . When it was over , I thanked my friend for inviting me . I hope to attend again soon ."

The clean dishes I helped her put away , and some dishes that still looked dirty we decided to wash again . The way we washed them was to rinse them all off first with warm water , then soap them up with a sponge . My mom did most of the washing , and after each dish was washed I would rinse and dry it . I like that part the best , because it is rewarding to see all the clean dishes in the cabinet that we worked so hard to empty out of the sink . The empty kitchen sink then had to be cleaned with soap and water too ! So we scrubbed it down , and finally we were done ."

First I put every bag on the dining room table , then I began emptying the bags one by one . I organized every item in the bags on the counter in the following categories : fridge items , kitchen pantry items , freezer items , storage pantry items , and cupboard items . I put all of the freezer items away first so that they would n't begin to thaw out , then I put everything that needed to go in the fridge away so it would n't spoil . Then I put the kitchen pantry and storage pantry items away , before finally putting the cupboard items in their proper place . I double checked to make sure that I had all the groceries put away , and then I took all of the plastic bags and put them in a storage bin where I keep plastic bags from stores . I like to reuse them when I can ."

After checking our cupboards and realizing we had a lot of bread , I decided that my breakfast would be a big , nice sandwich . The great thing about sandwiches , is that you can put almost anything on a piece of bread and it will taste so different every time depending on what you put on it ! I rinsed off the lettuce , and placed it on top of the mayonnaise , followed by cheese and pickles . I squeezed some mayonnaise on top of the bread acting as a lid , too , before I smushed them together . Now I had made my breakfast sandwich ."

We used our phones to Google the nearest theaters . We live in a city and do n't have a car , so we had to go somewhere that we could walk or take public transportation to . We decided on an AMC theater that shows about 15 different movies . She asked me if I wanted to see something in 3D , but unfortunately wearing the glasses makes me dizzy sometimes , so I said no . She asked if I wanted to see a comedy or and action movie . I usually prefer comedies , but then we realized that it was only showing once that day , and it was n't until much later . We knew it would take us about 30 minutes to get there , so we decided on an action movie that started in and hour and 15 minutes ."

When we were almost there , I noticed that the front tire on my bicycle felt rather wobbly and was most likely flat . I was in luck however , as my friend had a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires . Once we arrived at my friend 's house , I asked my friend if he let me borrow his bicycle repair kit . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . Finally , I pumped air into the tire until it was filled up and the bicycle was ready to be ridden again ."

They look happy and very active . The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food . I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction .  You ca n't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky . I try to get just the right amount . The fish get really active when they notice food and immediately start eating .  Fish are so easy ."

Then finally , one day an ex girlfriend tells me that if you pour bleach into a clogged toilet and let it sit for awhile that it will dissolve in there and somehow make the toilet flush able . Since then I do n't even have a plunger and any time I can I share the knowledge with others who do the same thing now and can not believe that it works . I do n't know how plungers even sell anymore ."

First , I had to figure out a meal that I could prepare that everyone would like . After deciding , I prepared the teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove using soy sauce and brown sugar . Once the sauce was done , I added some chopped up chicken and mixed it well to make sure the chicken got an even coating of sauce . Separately from this , I cooked about 3 cups of rice in the rice cooker . Once they all got home from school and work , they were pleased to find that I had made dinner , and they all seemed to think it was delicious ."

I put the letter inside the envelope and lick the sticky side of the flap . I press down the sticky part of the flap against the envelope to make sure my letter stays safe inside . On the front of the envelope , I write where my friend lives in the center , and where I live in the top left corner . I put a stamp on the top right corner , which shows the postal service that I have paid them .

We gather all of the plastic cups from our grocery store play set and put them on the table in front of the teddy bears . Then we sit at the big table and wait ... `` Wheeeee '' said the kettle as mother scurries over to take it off of the stove . Gives up each a teacup with little flowers on it , and then puts a tea bag in each one . The teddy bears will have to pretend . When she pours the water into our cups , the teabag turns the water brown ! It 's like magic . Then when we are done making the water brown , we take out the teabags and plop a little bit of sugar into our cups . I love tea parties with Veronica and Megan ."

There we show the attendant our tickets in order to let the airline know that we have arrived at the airport for our flight . We hand over our larger suitcases that will be stored in the cargo area of the plane during the flight . My husband 's suitcase is a little heavy , so the attendant weighs it to make sure it 's not over the 50 lb limit that my airline requires . Once our bags were checked , the attendant put a tag on them indicated which flight they will be going on . After we have checked in , we take our carry on bags and tickets and head to the security station . When we arrived at the security station , we stood in a long line and show a TSA agent our drivers license . We placed the tub and our carry on luggage on a table that x-rays your luggage to make sure you are not carrying anything dangerous on the plane . We also had to go through a metal detector . Once we were done we headed to the gate where our plane would be leaving ."

Then I took each receipt and entered the amount that I spent in the appropriate column and any deposits in its appropriate column as well .  Then I kept doing that until all my receipts were done .  The way I checked that is I logged on to my bank account online . If I saw that it was posted then I un-highlighted the item until I saw that they were all clear . Then I take my balance that I have on Excel and match it with the balance on my bank account on line .  If they matched , I would be done .  However , they did n't match so I had to go back and look at each item again and see what I left out or maybe put in twice .  I found my error and I was done ."

This year we planned a mini vacation to a local safari zoo . My husband and I spent hours online searching for something fun and interesting to do . We found a zoo two hours south of us that has hands on safari tours . I called the zoo and scheduled a private tour for our girls . After we booked the tour , my husband and I went online to find local hotels . We went through all the listings and found a suite with a kitchen that we thought would work best for us . We looked up directions on MapQuest to get to the location , and are excited to start our trip this Friday morning ."

We became warm and also roasted some marsh mellows , and made some smores . Then it was getting late so we all went to sleep . The next day we went on a hike in the woods and walked around the whole day . Then we were getting hungry so we ate our food . After that we set up another fire and told scary stories .

I spent several hours dancing at the party and ended up having a bit too much to drink so I called an Uber to go home and had to come back for my car the next day ."

The wait staff was very pleasant and well mannered and it was a quiet ambient setting . I decided to order steak -LRB- I normally order fried chicken everywhere I go -RRB- I wanted it medium rare and made that very clear to the waiter , I saw him jot it down when I said it . I waited about 40 minutes which seemed strangely long given there was only 2 other couples in the restaurant one of which already had their food . I pick up my fork with my left hand and my knife with the other . I begin to cut into the steak and realize it 's taking more effort than I expected . I realized why ; it was because my steak was very well done , and dry . I figured I would at least taste it and give it a chance , I do n't like to complain . I called the waiter over and politely explained to him that I knew it was n't his fault , but the steak was not made to order . He offered to bring me another steak , but I sent the steak back and told him I 'd rather just have the fried chicken ."

In all I went to about 35 different places and I got a couple of call backs for interviews . I decided to take the job that was close to where I lived so that I would n't have to spend so much time traveling .

I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun .

After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner , I took a look around my flat to assess my work . My apartment was now clean and it felt great !"

The main options for getting around are walking , taking the subway , bus , or taxi . We usually took the subway around , but decided to take a taxi from my hotel to see the Lion King on Broadway . I went out of the hotel and hailed a taxi by holding my hand up like you might see in the movies . A yellow taxi pulled up to stop , and I got inside . The driver did n't talk much , and drove a little quickly for my liking , but I got there much sooner than the other transportation options would have taken . I paid the driver the fare on the meter , plus a little tip , and went inside to enjoy the show ."

It is important to only do this activity at the beach because that is the safest place to have a bonfire . My friends and I planned to have a bonfire last night . I was in charge of collecting enough wood for the fire , so I spent the day doing just that . I met my friends at the beach and we started assembling a `` pit '' for the fire . The pit is a circle made with rocks , this keeps the fire contained . We then added the wood to the fire and lit the wood to start the bonfire . Bonfires are a great way to spend time with friends ."

By pressing the correct numbers , I was able to reach the store manager who told me the store 's hours . So I drove safely , but quickly to the store to retrieve the DVD player , a nice card and gift bag for her birthday present . Then I put it all in the bag and drove to her house for her birthday dinner . I was relieved to be able to find the gift in time before the store closed ."

We set the sauna for 175 degrees and set a timer for 30 minutes . We both chose to go in nude and just sit on a towel . The smell of the cedar when we walked in instantly soothed me . After that we left and we each left the cashier a 10 dollar tip . I cant wait to go back next week ."

Once the machine read my card I pulled it out then entered my pin number . After the company confirmed that I had money in my account they allowed me to select my fuel grade , which for me is mid-grade . I lifted the gas pump , opened my gas tank , slide the nozzle inside , pulled the trigger , and began pumping gas into my car . Once the pump shut off I knew my tank was full so I removed the nozzle returning the pump to its proper place . Once I was buckled I started my car and took off once more ."

When I got home , I felt the soil of the basil and mint and felt it was a bit dry . So I poured some water from the tap into a glass and then slowly poured it into the two pots until they felt moist . Today I read the instructions for caring for the orchid carefully . It said that instead of using normal water , that I should actually use ice cubes . I pulled three ice cubes out of a tray in the freezer and carried them over to the plant in my hand . I then put a reminder in my smartphone 's calendar to tell me to put ice cubes in the pot one week later ."

I arrived just before dark so I had to hurry to get things set up .  Then I set up the tent and put my sleeping bag inside . As the last light of the day began to fade I hurried and gathered wood for a fire . I set up a fire pit surrounded by rocks .  I had a lighter so I did n't need to resort to any slamming of rocks or rubbing of sticks . Once the fire was nice and big I made a dinner of hotdogs and marshmallows . Then I went to sleep under the stars ."

So I went to the hardware store and bought a plunger which is like a rubber suction cup on a wooden stick . Then I drove back home and I opened the toilet lid . I flushed it again after the water settled , just to make sure it was really clogged . and I pushed and pushed and pushed until the water went down a little more and then I could tell that the toilet paper was slowly unclogging from the toilet . I pushed down a little more just to be sure , then I flushed the toilet again . It flushed successfully and all of the water went down the toilet like it is supposed to . Then I placed the plunger beside the toilet in case I needed it again ."

Then we bought our lift tickets , attached them to the zippers on our jackets , and went over to the lift . We put our skis on and got on the lift to take it to one of the easier hills .  We wanted to start slowly before we went on the more difficult hills .  We stood side by side and pushed off .

I wake up to my alarm clock and then go to the bathroom and take a shower . I use an electric toothbrush that cleans my teeth really well . I take the toothpaste out of the bathroom cabinet and grab my toothbrush from the toothbrush holder on the sink . I put toothpaste on the toothbrush and then put the toothbrush in my mouth . Once the toothbrush is in my mouth I turn it on and the head of the toothbrush begins to spin . What I really like about my toothbrush is that it vibrates every 30 seconds to let you know how long you have been brushing . I then spit out the toothpaste in the sink and rinse off the toothbrush . I finish off by lightly rinsing my mouth out with water ."

In terms of food , I kept the invite simple , order takeout from the local chinese restaurant with the event starting at 6PM on a Friday night .

I decided to put my anger aside , and do a good deed . We made Chilli , lasagna , a cake , chicken amongst other things .

I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit ."

It is a cotton shirt with printed logo of my favorite band . To avoid melting the design , I placed the iron on a low temp and placed a towel over the shirt so the iron would not touch the design . I ironed the shirt sleeves first , starting with the shoulder and working my way back and forth perpendicular to the fibers towards the arm opening . I repeated the process for the body of the shirt , then hung it on a hanger while I ironed the pants . The pants would need to be ironed at a higher temperature , So I turned the iron up , placed the jeans on the ironing board with the jeans laying there like someone where wearing them ."

The nurse finally called me back . I started with the nurse taking my weight and height . She then took a few more things such as blood pressure and my temperature . Once we were done with that , she led me to my room to see the Dr. Once he arrived , he asked me a few questions about my overall health . He said that everything seemed just fine . I left shortly after . Got into my car and drove back home . My visit was good ."

In order to decorate , we need to go buy a tree . My wife and I got out of the car and walked over the the large rows of Christmas Trees . We know that we needed something that was n't going to be too tall and would n't fit in our living room . Also , we needed one that was going to be wide and big around . It was just a little taller than I was . It had a wide base with branches all around it , and it looked very fresh and healthy . We walked over to the farmer who was at the end of the row and paid him for the tree . They chopped it down for us and wrapped it in a protective wrapping to withstand the wind on our drive back . We tied down the tree to the roof with cables and make sure it was tight and secure . After so , we drove back home with our newly bought Christmas tree ."

On the bottom of the clock I saw what looked like a little rectangular door with a latch on one side . The little rectangular door came off the clock and underneath I saw two batteries . They said AA on them , so I knew they were double A. I went into the kitchen and found some double A batteries in a drawer . I took them back to the clock , and pulled the old batteries out of the clock . I checked inside the clock where the batteries had been and saw a picture of a battery in each spot where the batteries go . I lined up the bumpy end and flat end of each battery with the picture inside the clock when I put the new batteries in . Then I put the little door back on the clock the same way i took it off , by pushing in on the latch and this time pressing it down into place ."

Once everything was all packed , I double-checked my travel checklist . I had n't forgotten a thing ! After standing in line and going through the metal detectors , we got to our terminal and waited for our plane to arrive to take us to Disney World . We flew on the airplane to Florida , and took a taxi to our hotel . We checked in , carried our bags up to our room , and then looked at the different brochures for Disney World . We made a list of things we would get started on the next day while we ate dinner we got from room service , then we went to sleep . In the morning , we got ready to go out by getting dressed , eating breakfast , and brushing our teeth . We grabbed our itinerary and started off . We crossed off a bunch of things on our to-do list every day . We ate breakfast and dinner at the hotel , but we always ate lunch out in the different parks . We bought souvenirs , too . We had a total blast !"

I was very excited . The garden shop had lots of different kinds of tree , apples , pears , plums and peaches . I decided I wanted a peach tree . All the trees for sale were only about as tall as I am , and very thin , to make it easier for one person to plant them . They were all in very big plastic pots , but would need to be planted in the ground to grow best . I put the tree in my cart and went to check out . The woman at the check out explained that when I got home I was going to have to dig a very big hole to put my tree in , and then give it lots of water every day for at least a week . I promised to do that . I wanted the tree to do well ."

Since we could n't lift certain heavy items , we found a moving company in the phone book and hired them . Bigger furniture like the couch and TV stand were safely packed in a big truck , by a local moving company . The moving company drove with us to New York City and helped us unload all of our furniture , and then we showed them where we wanted it in the house ."

There were books for little kids , books for people like me , books for grown-ups , and every kind of book in between . On the way there , I grabbed a basket so that I would n't have to carry all my books around and make my arms tired . The books were lined up in ABC order on the shelves , using the author 's last name to show where they were supposed to go . I found a book about dragons , another book about pirates , and a book about kangaroos . I grabbed all of them and put them in my basket . When I had enough , I went and found my mom in the grown-up section . She had a book about dragons and pirates , too . Holding my hand , we walked up to the checkout counter . I put my basket on the counter and the woman behind the cash register scanned them with a red laser that told her how much each book cost . When she told my mom , my mom pulled a plastic credit card out of her purse . Then the woman put our books in a shopping bag . I took the bag and my mom and I left the store to go home ."

This would help me get all of my things ready for the day and get to school on time . One morning , though , the alarm clock did n't go off , and I ended up waking up and going to school much later than usual . After school that day , I realized that the battery on the alarm clock was probably dead , so I walked to a convenience store close to my school to pick up some batteries . I had my mom pick me up from the store , and after getting home , I changed the batteries on the alarm clock . That night , I set my usual alarm , and sure enough , it went off right on time the next morning . Unlike the day before , I was able to get all of my things ready and be at school right on time ."

First , we thought about a good location , and decided to go to a state park not very far away . The park has lots of picnic tables , plus trails for hiking and other activities we could do after eating . We put some ice in the bottom of the cooler . After that , we put in some bottled water , then potato salad and fruit , stored in their own sturdy plastic containers . The sandwiches went on top , where they would n't get squished by the heavier items . We packed the cooler in the trunk of my car , along with some sunscreen and bug spray , and drove to the state park . While we ate our meal , we watched the wildlife nearby . Squirrels played in the tree , birds flew overhead , and a deer cautiously crept out of the woods to graze at the edge of the clearing . When we finished eating , we picked up all of the trash and put it into a bag . We carried the cooler and the trash back to the car and put it away before going hiking ."

I like to fry my fish , so I season it with a number of thinks and then make sure to cover it in flour and bread crumbs . I then heat the oil I will be using to fry it to a very hot temperature and then dunk the fish in the oil until it is nice and brown ."

Now , one by one I coated fish in seasoned flour and set aside . I put them in refrigerator for half an hour . When It became hot enough , I slowly put pieces of fish one by one , next to each other . Did not overcrowd them . I let it cook each side for at least 3 to 4 minutes , and then turned them over , and cooked another 3 minutes on medium temperature . It was very crispy and delicious ."

My senior year of high school was going to be different . We had a true star quarterback named Johnny .  Even though I was n't very good , he never made me feel bad about it , even as he would make amazing 60 yard passes every game . Sure enough , with Johnny at the lead , we finally won a state championship my senior year . It was a good year to be playing football ."

Before they arrived , I made sure that my outlets still had child covers on them so there would be no chance of either child getting hurt on the outlet . I also put baby gates across the stairs leading downstairs . I would never want them to tumble down . When my sister arrived , she gave me information on when they normally eat a snack and lunch and what time they usually take a nap . She also gave me a diaper bag with extra diapers , wipes , a change of clothes and a favorite toy . I was certainly going to do that . Our first task was building large colorful towers with duplo blocks that my niece loved to knock over and my nephew loved to rebuild . We listened to \" The Wiggles \" and danced and sang and then it was time for a potty break / diaper change and a snack . With both kids rubbing their eyes , it was very apparent that it was now nap time , right on schedule . After a nap and a lunch of small pieces of chicken and vegetables with mac and cheese , I heard a knock on the door and my sisters voice ."

I looked in my fridge and pantry to see what ingredient I was missing . I also looked at commonly used items , such as milk , bread , and eggs to make sure that I had them . I wrote down anything that was almost gone or completely gone . I then wrote down any household items that I needed , like paper towels and laundry soap . I am planning to have friend over this weekend for a cookout , and needed paper plates . I included these on my list . After finishing my list , I read through it and double checked it before taking it with me to the grocery store ."

I knew I had to change the batteries . This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work .  I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required : two AA-sized batteries . These are quite common , and I got them from the kitchen drawer . I removed the old batteries by lifting them up , then I placed the new batteries in the same position , making sure the plus-side of the batteries -LRB- the little tip -RRB- were in the right direction , as it is usually engraved on the plastic .  I adjusted the time with the help of my watch , and went to bed , knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning ."

The last time we decided to play a movie , my husband went to the `` on demand '' feature on our TV and scrolled through all the `` new release '' movies that were available . We both saw a few movies that we wanted to watch , but we did n't want to watch all of the same movies , so we needed to decide on one . We finally decided to watch a movie we both agreed on . We both watched the movie in quiet without any one disturbing us . It was really nice . I look forward to having those movie days with my husband since they are few and far between these days ."

Next we had to make sure it was very clean . Once , the area was completely clean , we put the glue all over the bare cement . Then we carefully laid down the floor pieces , making sure that the pattern was aligned correctly . The final step was to wait for the entire thing to dry . When we got back home , we admired our new floor with pride . It felt really nice to replace the floor ourselves and it made the house look great ."

We played flag football , which means that you grab the flag off someone instead of tackling them .

I placed each vegetable on the cutting board and began to cut them with a large knife , making sure to remove peels and stems that were inedible . I threw these parts away in the garbage . I made sure to cut the vegetables into small , bite-sized pieces and slices , especially the larger vegetables like broccoli and lettuce . As I finished cutting each vegetable , I put it into a large bowl . Once all of the vegetables were chopped up , I put my cutting board and knife into the sink to be washed later ."

I unfolded the changing mat on the ground , put on some gloves , and gently placed the baby on the changing mat . I rolled the dirty diaper into itself and placed it in the diaper disposal can right next to me . I used some wipes to clean the baby off , then took a new diaper out of her diaper container . I opened up the new diaper and lifted up the baby 's legs to put the diaper underneath her . I made sure the diaper was secure so there would n't be any leaking , and then I rebuttoned the baby 's onesie ."

We also used the grabber to pick up the fruit that had fallen off the tree onto to ground . We filled out bucket and headed inside . Next , we got out our juicer . Then , we cut the oranges in half and pressed the on top the juicer , catching the juice in a container . We poured our juice over ice and had the most delicious glass of fresh orange juice ever !"

I got out my bread board and found my large chef knife in the knife rack . I took the oranges to the sink and washed all the oranges . I then began to cut all of the oranges in half .  It is a hand juice and takes a little muscle to get all the juice out . I transfer the juice to a pitcher . After I had juiced all 12 oranges , I had enough for a full pitcher of orange juice .  It was delicious ."

I sprinkled some salt , pepper and herbs over the top of the chops and I added a little bit of broth , too , so the meat would n't dry out . When the oven was hot enough I put the dish in the oven and set the timer for 20 minutes . While the meat was cooking , I cooked some vegetables too . After 20 minutes , I put on oven gloves to protect my hands , and took the dish out of the oven . When I knew they were hot enough I served dinner to my family ."

I did n't have any cash on me , which is good because I would have wanted to use my credit card anyway . Then I chose regular unleaded gas , and opened my gas tank . I started pumping , and locked the handle in place so I did n't have to hold it while the tank filled . It automatically filled up , and then I replaced the pump in the machine . I like to get a receipt because it helps me keep track of how often I need gas , so I pressed YES when the machine asked me if I wanted one ."

I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters , and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl .

He said that prices tend to be cheaper on certain days of the week and you should clear your search history to avoid the airlines keeping the prices high . This took a lot of work and required me looking around at different airlines for the perfect fight .

Unfortunately , I also had to pick seats and pay more and also pay more for bags ."

Fred had been laid off for two weeks at the beginning of the month , so things had been a little tighter than usual . Fred wrote checks for home and entertainment ; the mortgage , all the credit cards , and any shopping bills for clothing and groceries .

I was scared . When she attempted to put the injection around my gums , as a knee-jerk reaction , I bit her finger . She was really unpleasant about it . So instead of attempting to numb the area again , she just pulled out my teeth with a pair of pliers while I screamed . She had me then bite on some thick gauze and lay back in the chair . I was given my teeth in a small , pink treasure chest and sent on my way . I do n't like going to the dentist anymore ."

We are usually very good about only getting what is on the list but sometimes we treat ourselves or find something on sale . Once we are done , we head to the registers and wait in line to make our purchases . When we get to the register we put our items on the conveyer belt so the clerk can scan them . At the end I make sure to pay for everything with my credit card . I make sure to keep my receipt out so the security guard can check it and we order a car service and go home ."

I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . Good to have a little bit of patience .

I drank water with dinner because I was driving last night . When my steak arrived I eagerly cut into it expecting it to be cooked exactly as I had ordered . Instead it was cooked well done , very well done . It is really rare that I send food back however this steak was not at all what I had ordered and something that I knew I would n't enjoy .

It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt , I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good . I wanted to get everything done in one day so I had worked very hard for a very long time . However , when I went inside to clean up , I realized from an automated message in my voice mail that the water had been shut off temporarily for emergency repairs , it would be on again in a few hours . I was frustrated , but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made myself a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat . I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked . I ran myself a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in it . I got in and found it very relaxing . I was so glad to finally take a bath , get cleaned up , and relax after a long , hard , productive day ."

Sometimes there are more forms , but you will always have a W-2 . These forms show the amount of money you have earned and the amount of money you have paid in taxes . Sometimes people pay too much , and sometimes people pay too little . Doing taxes corrects for that . To figure out if you paid too much , not enough , or just the right amount I like to use computer software . It is very easy . The computer screen will ask a series of questions and tell you which numbered box on your form you can find that answer . If you paid too little , you will have to pay the government money , but usually people have paid too much and get money back ."

We loaded the boat up with our fishing gear , some snacks and drinks , and our bucket of bait . We spent a few hours fishing on the lake , taking turns casting our rods out over the water . My cousin caught two fish , but I didnt catch any . By then the sun was making it very warm on the water , so we headed back to the shore . My cousin backed his Ford Tempo almost into the water to hook the boat back up . Then we drove home and ate the fish for dinner ."

There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all ."

Because of this , I answered the phone and was pleasantly surprised to hear the voice of one of my good friends on the other line . Once I knew that it was in fact one of my friends , we talked on the phone for about 2 hours just trying to catch up with what we 've been doing .

Once that was up , we put painter 's tape down to protect the floor and fixtures , and to keep the corners of the room clean . After that , we put paint into a paint tray and painted the ceiling with a roller . Once we completed the paint job , we laid down the new carpet . We finished up by putting in the new fixtures and light switches . Our bedroom looks much nicer now ."

When I was growing up I played a lot of video games on my Super Nintendo , then my Playstation and then my Playstation 2 . Since I finished High School and started working though I gave them a break as I prefer to do something more productive with my time . Especially when I was on break from school or on the weekends when I had no friends or family to play with it was the perfect thing for me to do to occupy my time . I used to love playing sports video games as I was and am a huge sports fan . I loved NFL Madden , NHL , MLB and NBA Live games and played them the most of any others ."

I then cracked open three eggs into a bowl , and sliced four hot dogs into diagonal slices . Once the water was boiling I added both the block of dried ramen and the seasoning packets from the package . I also added the sliced hot dogs , as well as two slices of Swiss cheese to give the broth more flavoring and creaminess . Finally , I poured the three eggs from the bowl into the pot and let it boil for an additional minute and a half before taking it off the heat . That way the egg whites would firm up , but the yolk would remain runny ."

After I put in the money I looked at all the choices in the machine , there was candy , nuts , crackers , and gum . I decided I wanted some candy and so I looked at what number it was and typed the number into the vending machine 's key pad . The vending machine took the candy and dispensed it for me and it fell to the bottom where I was able to pick it up . I then got my change back ."

I first sorted out types of clothes from the basket - shirts in one pile , pants in another , and socks and underwear in another . I took a t-shirt out of the pile , flipped it over so that the back of the shirt was facing me and laid it out flat on the table . I then folded the right arm straight down so that the arm of the shirt faced the middle , then the left side so that it looked like the arms were crossed on the shirt . I picked it up , flipped it back over and the shirt was perfectly folded ! Boy this task was getting boring - I decided to do this while watching TV and moved the basket , and piles of clothing that were already folded to a nice comfy big chair , turned the TV on , found a favorite program and plopped down to continue the task of folding clothes . Ahhh much better ! Then came a pair of pants which I held up in front of me , folding the side-seems of the legs so that they met together at the legs . I put the pants in a stack of the same type of clothing that had already been folded and continued getting all those clothes folded and ready to put away . Next came socks , find the mate to the sock needing to be folded , put them together and take one sock , folding the top over the other like you are making a cuff after you have put it on your foot , keep pushing the other sock in so that it looks like you have a small ball when you are done . Yaaay , socks are all done , now it 's underwear next ! I pulled a pair of panties out of the basket , laid it out flat and then folded each side so that it met in the middle , then the bottom so that it to met in the middle then flipped it over , and started a pile of freshly folded underthings . For things like bras , I folded the cups together , the back so that it fit inside the cup , and the straps down . Soon with the help of glancing at the favorite TV program , the basket was empty , and laundry all folded - yippeeee !"

After they have eaten they will need to go to the bathroom like grownups . However , because they can not stand or sit by themselves , their mothers and fathers let them wear large plastic pants that the babies use to pee or poop in . After the baby has used their pants to go to the bathroom someone must change the plastic pants and put clean ones on the baby . The parent or helper will gently lay the baby on their back , usually on a padded table . Then the helper will take the plastic pants off the baby . The baby will need to be cleaned . Usually someone will use a towel that has been moistened to wipe the baby 's rear end and legs and anywhere else that is soiled . Then the parent or helper will gently lift the baby 's bottom and slide another pair of clean plastic pants under the baby 's bottom . Now the baby is clean !"

I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed . When I had found everything I needed , and put them in my cart , I walked over to the checkout lanes . Finally , it was my turn and the checkout person checked me out . I paid my bill , and walked out to my car with the shopping cart . Then I loaded the car up with the groceries , returned the cart and drove home ."

When we got up to the counter , we were handed menus . The milkshakes looked good , but I did n't want to get too much food and feel sick afterward . I decided to get a burger , fries , and a soda . My partner got the same , but with seasoned fries instead of regular fries . We gave our orders to the woman behind the counter , paid , and waited until our food was ready . We both liked our food , although we did like the burgers better than the fries . When we were done , we waited to see what we should do with our garbage because we did n't see trash cans . We noticed that the people who work at the restaurant take away trash after customers are done eating , so we left our trays on the table ."

Our day is long sometimes because the kids get there really early so their parents can go to work .  In the mornings its still dark out so we let the kids go back to sleep when they get dropped off .  I have to go into the kitchen part of our room and get out all the cereal and milk . Next i set the table and then I wake up the kids . After the kids eat breakfast we all pitch in and clean up while we sing a clean up song .  The next part of our day we spend outside if it is nice , we run around play games and exercise .  Almost like the morning time but nap first and then eat . After lunchtime we play again . And then we rest gain till parents get here ."

Instead of buying bottled juice , we planned to prepare fresh orange juice . Our parents shopped good , fresh oranges . I and Kevin peeled the oranges well . Once we done peeling all the oranges , we blend them all using a blender . Kevin tasted the juice and complained that the juice was very tangy . So we added some water and sugar to it to get good taste . If we add more water , the taste of the juice will get spoiled . Finally we got good taste . We asked our mom to taste the juice and finalize it . She also liked the juice and we were very happy on the preparation of our first fresh orange juice ."

My teacher equipment includes things like bones , insect specimens , and rocks and minerals . After I have written out what I am going to speak to the students about , I have to decide which equipment to use . One day I might give a big talk on insects . I get them out of their boxes and get them ready to pass around so my students can look at them while I talk about insects . That way everything is ready and I do n't have to go looking for anything . I keep the boxes nearby so that after my presentation I can put away my equipment ."

Then My wife came to me and asked what is my plan for our son 's birthday . I told her , '' `` oh ! I forgot . we have to plan something . That is on next Saturday '' '' . So we need to make a list for groceries for that . My wife helped me to prepare a list . These days groceries are very pricey . So I checked the deals online . So me and my son went to the shop . My son likes grocery shopping very much . When we reached the grocery shop , I asked my son to sit in the cart . Most of the groceries in my list are on sale . I bought almost everything in my list . I saved a lot on that day because of the deal . After paying the bill , we went out of the shop and kept everything inside the car and left to home ."

When it was finally my turn I handed my withdraw slip to the teller . She was n't very friendly and seemed to be rushing . It makes me nervous when they rush at the bank because what if they do n't count my money correctly ? She seemed annoyed when she asked for two forms of identification to be able to access my account and I had to dig around in my purse to find my wallet . She asked me to wait while she goes and gets the money . She finally came back and counted my money out for me and told me to have a great day and rushed me out of the line immediately calling for the next person ."

First , I went to my room to find my swimsuit , my sandals , my sunglasses , and my tote bag . Then , I grabbed a beach towel for each of us from the linen closet in the hallway . My sister reminded me that we need to protect our skin from the sun , so I went to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet to look for the sunscreen . I took it from the bottom shelf and threw it into my tote bag . We left our house , and walked for about 10 minutes until we got to the beach . Once we arrived at the beach , we had to look for a place to set down our things . My sister saw some of her friends , so we walked over to where they were sitting and placed our beach towels on the sand next to them . My sister had to put the sunscreen on my back for me . I put on my sunglasses , and laid down to relax in the sun . It was a fun day ."

I looked through several sections but did n't find anything that I liked yet . Some of the trees were too small and would have had to struggle for sunlight . Some of the trees were too delicate and would have been too hard to take care of . In the next section , I found the perfect tree . It was just the right size and it did n't need a lot of special attention . I took it home and planted it ."

Once we arrived at the first store , we browsed through the clothes on the racks looking for the styles and sizes that would best suit my daughter . She picked a few things , and we headed for the dressing room . She tried on each of the items she had selected , and if she liked the item , we checked the price tag .  If the item was too expensive , we put it in the reject pile . After she tried on everything we had taken into the dressing room , we took our purchase pile to the customer service counter to pay for our items .

I took an herbal tea box off the shelf , opened the box and took out a tea bag . Then I went to the cupboard and took out a yellow microwavable mug . I put the mug in the microwave oven on high for two minutes . I then put the mug on a saucer and let it sit for ten or fifteen minutes until the tea got darker . It took awhile for the tea to finish brewing , as it is not necessary to heat it for the whole time , since it it is still very hot when it comes out of the microwave . Then I drank the herbal tea ."

My mom had a tray she used for parties , so I pulled that down from the cupboard , too . I took the Coke out of the fridge and poured it into two cups , then added some ice cubes from the freezer . I poured that into one cup and added more ice cubes before putting the pitcher in the fridge again . Finally , I pulled out the orange juice carton and filled the last two cups . Then I put the carton back in the fridge and the five cups on the tray . When I got there , I set the tray down on the coffee table and handed out the first drink .

Once the dog is older , they are already set in their ways and it could be very difficult to train them to do new things .  Lets start with an eating schedule . Most dogs will want to eat anything in front of them at any time , but you must train them to eat at certain times , and where they will get their meals . By putting a bowl of food out at the same time , each day , the dog will get used to eating at those times .  If the dog does n't eat when they are supposed to , remove their bowl after 15 minutes . They will learn for next time , if they do n't eat when food is given to them , they do n't get to eat ."

I start with my most important bills first .  I have to pay them all , but I like to get the most important ones out of the way first .  The month important ones would be mortgage payment for my house , then my electric bill that includes my water , then my internet bill , then cable TV .

Our guests were another married couple that we have been friends with for a long time . We sat and talked for awhile and then we had some pizza and talked some more .

The band came out on stage and rocked the house for a solid 30 minutes before taking a brief intermission .  Also there was an NBA playoff basketball game between the Rockets and Trail Blazers playing on a television , so I decided to watch that during intermission . When the band came back on I went back to my table to watch them perform . They performed for another 45 minutes , then the concert was over .  We all agreed that the band was fantastic . It was a night well spent ."

It makes me feel peaceful to sit and watch the fish as they drift and swim around . I have taken great care in selecting the fish that go into the tank , to make sure they will all get along . There is an expert at the fish store who gives me instructions on how to make sure the fish are happy and healthy in their environment . I love to lift the lid of the tank and sprinkle their special food onto the surface of the water . The fish rise to the surface and begin to eat the food . They know it 's dinner time , based on my motions and the lifting of the lid ."

He than told them their promises they would make to each other and asked them if they would live those promises . Afterwards , we celebrated with a party at the bride 's house down the street ."

We then walked to the concession stand to buy some snacks to eat during the movie . It was really expensive ! After buying our snacks , we decided to go into the theater . Because we were still early , we had no problem finding a seat . Both of us like to sit right in the middle of the theater , because it has the best view .

First , I removed the small door to the battery compartment to check what kinds of batteries were needed . Then I went to the hall closet , and took out two AA batteries . I went back to my camera , with the battery compartment open , and shook it gently until the dead batteries fell out . I then looked into the compartment to see which end of the battery should go in first . I slid a battery - side first into the right slot , and + side first into the left slot . I turned my camera on to check that the new batteries were working , and they seemed to work fine . I then took the old batteries and put them in the box of other old batteries to be recycled ."

Now I know its missing some color . So I wash out some lettuce and tomatoes and onions for my sandwich . Once done , I now layer the vegetables on my sandwich and close it with the top piece . Oh wait I need a few more things to make my lunch complete . Back to the refrigerator I go and grab the peppers and over to the pantry for potato chips . I guess I will need a drink to go with this lunch so I grab a water bottle ."

I asked for fish because I thought that they would be easy to take care of . When I was about 7 years old , my parents bought a huge aquarium and put it in our living room , and later that day , we went to the store and picked up some fish to put into it . Every now and then during the day , I would take the fish flakes that we bought from the same store and sprinkle enough into the tank for all the little fish to eat some . I did this every day that we had that aquarium ."

If it 's a cold drink you want to keep it cold and if it 's a hot one you want to keep it hot , so you select what you might need for this purpose . You might want to include ice or chilled glasses , or potholders or a trivet if something is very hot . You will also want to protect the surface the beverage will rest on so you might want to supply small napkins or coasters . When your supplies for preparing and serving the drink are assembled sometimes you simply pour the beverage into the serving container and serve it , or you need to mix or prepare the beverage and then pour it into the serving container and then present it either to your guest , or place it on a serving table where guests will pour their own . Depending on the situation , you might set out a pitcher or a carafe of a beverage along with glasses or cups for guests to serve themselves ."

They bought a house that was pretty close to the rental one , which is funny because the other house was about the same distance away . It was n't as big enough for the dog . The old place I actually preferred , since it was a bit bigger . Also I parked my car in front of the new one , and someone clipped it and knocked off part of a panel . That was annoying .

I started with the pancakes . I mixed the batter according to the box that it came from , and made enough for the family on the griddle . I laid down an entire package 's worth of bacon on the griddle and cooked it until most of the fat was cooked off . Lastly , the eggs . I scrambled the eggs myself with a fork , and made some for everyone but myself , since I do n't like eggs . When my family woke up , they immediately came to the kitchen and saw that I made them all breakfast ."

We put the meat on , and everyone started commenting on how good it smelled . While everything was cooking , I put paper plates and silverware on a table next to the barbecue . Once the meat was done , I put it to the side and let everyone make their own dish . Everyone talked about how good everything tasted , and a few people even complimented my cooking skills .

I considered the number of bedrooms and I decided on two so that I would have a home office as well as someplace for guests to stay when they visit from out of town . I did n't want to spend too much money on monthly rent , so I decided that I would n't mind living on the second floor and that I could go without a dishwasher . It seemed like everything near the city was too expensive . I began to be concerned when I had n't found a suitable place to live after a few weeks of looking . Persistence paid off when I found a two bedroom apartment that was a short drive to the city . Since it was not yet rented , I set up a time to look at the place and I ended up loving it . So , I signed the lease , paid a security deposit , the first month of rent , and moved into the flat ."

We devised a system where he would stay in the truck and I would bring out all the small furniture items and he would stack them . When we finished that task , we moved on to the larger items . These items took both of us to load onto the truck .  My son is over six feet and I 'm really short , so we had a lot of trouble getting the mattress out of the door and onto the truck ! We finished moving all the furniture in record time , returned the truck and sat down for some cold lemonade ."

She lives very far away , so writing letters is one of the ways she stays in touch . My grandma wrote to ask how I was and tell us about her visit to the beach a few weeks ago . I liked reading about her adventures at the beach . In the letter , she wrote about how she found seashells in the sand . Reading a letter from my grandma is a nice way to know what she is doing , even though I can not always see her . Now it is my turn to write a letter to my grandma so she can receive one in the mail too !"
