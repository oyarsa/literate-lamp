Last week , my girlfriend and I decided to renovate our basement . We wanted to make it look new and fresh . First , we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures , deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room . We then made a list of things we needed to buy at the store to accomplish this renovation . We came back home and began working in the basement . We worked together and removed certain things first . Then , we painted the basement walls together . Then , we hung pictures on the walls that we 'd bought . We then placed a few items like a couch and large TV that we 'd bought in the basement . We added our new carpets too . Finally , we put the popcorn machine in the corner of the basement and our basement looked new and fresh ! Our basement had been nicely renovated indeed !#Where did they go with the list?#The supermarket.	0

The sharp buzz of the washing machine timer distracted me from the television show flickering on the screen . I thought about ignoring it , but I had an early shift at the diner the next morning and my only pair of black pants were in the laundry load . I went down the steep stairs to the basement where the laundry room sat , out of the way . I opened the washer and sighed as I looked inside . I grabbed an armful of the clothes from the washer and tossed them into the dryer , than repeated the process until the washer was empty . Without much thought , I tossed in a dryer sheet and slammed the door . I checked the settings , adjusted a few , and heard the comforting hum of the dryer coming to life . Satisfied that I would be ready for work the next day , I returned up the stairs to my television show .#Where were the pants?#in the laundry load	1

I wanted to take a photograph of something natural . So I decided to go out side and see what I could take a picture of . After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later .#When did they decide whether or not to use the Flash?#After getting the whole tree in the picture	0

I wanted to take a photograph of something natural . So I decided to go out side and see what I could take a picture of . After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like .

After I finished university , I wanted to move out on my own . I waited a while and lived with my parents for a few months . I was n't too happy with that situation though because I wanted freedom , I wanted to be able to meet people , go out at night , lay on the couch and watch TV all day if that 's what I felt like doing .  I started dating my boyfriend and we had been together for almost six months when we made the decision to move in together .  All the apartments we saw were either terrible or beautiful but incredibly expensive . Eventually we found what that was beautiful , spacious and looked perfect for us and it was priced very well . So we took the leap and we decided to buy the flat .#What did they make?#a decision to move in together	1

Sometimes I really hate visiting the doctor . But at the same time I feel good because if anything is wrong with me the doctor will be able to help . When I think I 'm either sick or just to make sure I 'm healthy I make a doctor appointment . When it 's 20 minutes before it 's time for my appointment , I leave my house to go . Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park . I walk inside the doctor 's office and check in with the receptionist . Once they call my name I go straight to the scale to get weighed , I always hate this part . Then the nurse takes me to the room , takes my blood pressure and asks why I 'm there . I 'm only there to check my cholesterol since last time I had it checked it was high . The doctor then comes in to talk about my last results and says that we will check it again today and then call him back in 3 months if it 's high to talk about my options . After that is done I go to the check out window and pay my copay for my visit .#Where do they get blood drawn?#at the doctor's office	1

First I turned on the computer to insert my hard-drive into . I then connected the projector so that I could screen my presentation to my colleagues . Once I had the computer and projector up and running I pulled down the screen in which the projector would be projecting onto . I took two deep breaths and performed a quick practice run in my mind while double checking that all of my equipment was up to par and ready for my big presentation . I also handed out paper copies of my presentation to my colleagues so they could be familiar with it if need be for future references . Once I got all I needed passed out for my presentation , it was showtime and I felt 110 percent ready to tackle my presentation .#What did they need to follow along with?#colleagues	0

Our regular piano player was out sick and could n't play piano for the Sunday service . Another member of our church remembered that I use to play piano , and asked if I would be interested in filling in . I was really nervous . It had been a long time since I have played in front of people and I was n't sure if I knew the songs well . They gave me the music ahead of time and I went home and practiced . I spent a lot of time learning the new songs . Finally it was Sunday and I was really nervous . I was n't sure I would know when to start playing or if I would remember the right keys . I was n't nervous anymore and just started playing . I really enjoyed myself . Afterwards everyone was telling me I did a good job and the Pastor asked if I would be interested filling in again if they needed someone .#When did service start?#Sunday	1

Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring .

When I cooked pasta last , I had a great experience . I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce . In order to do this , we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box . As we put the pasta in , we stirred it and watched the water boil . After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes , we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat . Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste , we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot . Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot , we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta .#When did the pasta taste amazing?#During the last time they cooked pasta	1

Yesterday was the first day of school for my children , Anna and Joseph . It was a beautiful warm , sunny morning so we decided to walk to school . After both Anna and Joseph had finished breakfast and dressed in their new school clothes , we walked out the front door of our house and started down the sidewalk toward Maple Grove Elementary .  It was a short walk through the neighborhood and we passed many of our friends and neighbors on the way .  Mr. Jones , the mail carrier , said " Good morning . Have a great first day ! " When we arrived across the street from the school , Mrs. Green , the Crossing Guard , said " Wait here please . "  She walked out into the street and held up her " STOP " sign to make it safe for us to cross .  Once we reached the other side of the street , we walked indoors and down the hall to Anna and Joseph 's classroom .#Who did he wish a good day?#he wished the crossing guard to have a good day	0

I approached the vending machine while pulling my wallet out of my back pocket . I stood in front of the machine and looked through the glass at all the choices in front of me . Did I want a bag of potato chips or a candy bar ? I decided I wanted a Reese 's peanut butter cups . I pulled two one dollar bills from wallet and placed them into the money slot and watched the machine grab and pull them inside . I saw that I now had $ 2.00 of credit . I pressed A7 on the keypad which was in front of the Reese 's peanut butter cups . I watched it drop down to bottom of the machine . I pushed the wide door open and grabbed my candy bar .

When I came home from work I noticed the trash in the kitchen was over flowing . I quickly gathered the trash that had fallen out , and put it in the bag . Pulling the bag out was heavy and difficult , but I finally got it up and out . I tied it tightly so nothing would come out and took it outside to the big trash can by the curb . The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out . I pulled open the top of the bag and shook it out to make it expand . I slid it down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure it did n't slip down in the can . Putting the top on the can I put it back by the refrigerator , and thought about what I was going to make for supper .#When did they get inside?#After they came home from work	1

When I came home from work I noticed the trash in the kitchen was over flowing . I quickly gathered the trash that had fallen out , and put it in the bag . Pulling the bag out was heavy and difficult , but I finally got it up and out . I tied it tightly so nothing would come out and took it outside to the big trash can by the curb . The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out .

One day , my wife asked me if I could take the children to school so that she could attend an important meeting with her boss . I said that I would . Once my three children were ready to go , we all hopped in the car and were on our way . Since the children were all in different grades , I had to go to two different schools to drop them all off . First I went to the local elementary school and dropped off Amy and Jessica , who are in 1st and 3rd grade , respectively . I waited to make sure that they got through the front door safely , then I continued to the local middle school to drop off my son Fred who is in the 7th grade . Once we arrived , I again waited in the car to make sure that Fred made it through the front door safely .#What did they get ready for?#practice	0

I was so excited to put the poster of my favorite sports team up after buying it . The poster came rolled up like a tube , and the first thing I did was gently unroll it , taking care to not damage any of the edges or corners . Once the poster was unrolled , I grabbed my roll of scotch tape . I decided the poster would look best on the wall next to my bed , so I held the poster to the wall . Once I was satisfied with the poster 's placement , I pulled off a piece of tape . I placed the piece of tape on the top center of the poster and then fastened it to the wall . I then pulled off a second piece of tape and stuck it the center area at the bottom of the poster . Once the poster was secured to the wall , I stepped back and enjoyed the picture of my favorite sports team !#When did they make sure it was straight?#Once they were satisfied with the placement	1

My wife and I decided to invite some friends over . We wanted to clean our and house and make it look good after it was messed up by my daughter . One of the first things that we did to clean was to get out the vacuum . I took the plug and put it in a socket that was close to the area of the floor that I wanted to clean . I hit the power button and the vacuum started to make a weird noise . I opened the vacuum up and cleaned the inside out . I pushed the vacuum all over the floor in every part of the house . It was very loud and it was nice to push the power button and turn it off when I was finished .#When could they take the vacuum out of the closet?#when leaving the house dirty	0

This week my mom assigned us all chores to do around the house . My chore was to clean the kitchen after dinner . After we all finished eating and everyone had left the table I started to clear it . Starting with the plates . Then carefully placed this in the sink . Then I placed each glass on top of the next . And once they were all stacked I used the top cup to gather he spoons and knifes and forks in . Finally I was able to wipe down and clean off the table top , making sure nothing was sticky or wet . I then decided I would place a small glass vase in the center of the now cleared kitchen table , with a few wildflowers from our own backyard garden .#When did they stack the plates?#while picking wildflowers	0

I had always wanted to learn to swim , but was really scared . They had just opened a new swimming pool in my town that was giving lessons , so I decided to sign up for a class . I was really nervous . When I got there everyone was already there . I could tell I was n't the only one that was nervous . The swim teacher was really nice and did a good job of calming our nerves . I felt so comfortable that I was already going under water and dog paddling by the end of the first class . I decided that I would continue to take the classes until I was swimming well . I have really enjoyed taking these classes and do n't know why I took so long to learn how to swim .#What would she not go back for if she didn't like it?#town	0

Yesterday , I was riding my bike when , all of a sudden , I hit a rock and fell . Oh no ! My pants were ripped . When I got home , my mother said that we could sew them . She said she would teach me how . First , we got a needle and a spool of blue thread . At first , I could n't put the thread through the hole in the needle , but eventually , I got it . We laid the pants on the table , and then my mother showed me how to sew . We poked the needle through the cloth , up through it , and then back down . It took me a long time , but by the end , there was no longer a rip in my pants .#What was done to the needle?#the needle was used to cut cloth	0

Last year I adopted my dog . First , I researched where the nearest animal shelters were around me . After I found a few animal shelters , I got into my car and drove to one of them . I visited with the animals , and saw one dog named Chester that I really liked . I went back home afterwards and began to research how to take care of pets . Once I had read about how to properly take care of an animal , I had to go and buy the supplies necessary . When I was all ready , I went back to the shelter and asked to adopt the dog . After I received all of the proper paperwork , I jumped back in the car with my new friend and drove home . It was a great decision .#What is the scenario in question?#Adopting a pet	1

Each and every six months , I have to visit the dentist , to make sure my teeth are healthy and clean . The last visit , I went in and said `` hello '' to the receptionist . She checked me in and said the hygienist would be with me shortly . The hygienist is the person you see first , who cleans your teeth with a scraper , flosses them , and sometimes treats them with a pasty substance called fluoride . He said I had one small cavity , which I normally do n't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months . A cavity can be a little scary , since the dentist goes in with a drill . I was scared it would hurt , but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in my mouth and injected something called Novocaine . Afterwards , I talked funny for a little while , but had healthy and clean teeth again .#What made their mouth go numb?#The hygienist used novocaine in the patient's mouth	1

The hygienist is the person you see first , who cleans your teeth with a scraper , flosses them , and sometimes treats them with a pasty substance called fluoride . He said I had one small cavity , which I normally do n't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months . A cavity can be a little scary , since the dentist goes in with a drill . I was scared it would hurt , but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in my mouth and injected something called Novocaine . Afterwards , I talked funny for a little while , but had healthy and clean teeth again .#What did they not feel after their mouth went numb?#the drill	1

I find doing laundry is relatively easy work . You just have to keep up . Every day I go around and collect all of the dirty clothes from the bedrooms and bathrooms and pile it all up outside the laundry closet -LRB- it is n't big enough to be called a laundry room . -RRB- I separate the clothes into their various loads ; underwear all goes into one pile , towels and wash rags go into another piles , jeans go into yet another pile and all the shirts go into another pile . I turn it on and let it start filling with water . I wait until the entire bottom is filled with water then I pour in the proper amount of detergent . Only then do I start loading in the clothes . I usually do it one article of clothing at a time , moving around the drum so the load stays balanced . Once it 's full , I simply close the door and let it run . When it stops , you take the clothes out and move them to the dryer .#When did the machine do all the work?#When training for a gold medal.	0

Last week , on a beautiful sunny afternoon , I decided to take my niece Kathy to the playground . We were lucky because there were other children about her age already playing on the swings and slides . Kathy is chatty and likes to make friends by asking kids if she can play with them . She soon began to speak to another little girl names Eva and they were soon taking turns pushing each other on the swing . The two friends then decided to get in line for the slide . Kathy went first because she is a little more daring and her friend . Eva had never been on the tallest slide at the playground before but when she saw Kathy go down without a problem , she felt brave too . After a while , Kathy and Eva got tired of climbing up the slide so they went off to the moneky bars . When it was time to go the new friends gave each other a hug and promised to see each other at the playground on the next sunny day .#Where were Kathy and Eva hung by their knees?#swing set	0

I am on ketogenic diet , so eggs are like life saver . I always buy good quality eggs . Other day I bought some free roaming eggs from market . I want to make scrambled eggs . Then with fork I whipped them for a while when they mixed very well , but did not overdo . I turned on my stove , put the nonstick pan on and turned stove on medium heat . Meanwhile I got some cheese and salsa out for extra flavor . When the pan was hot enough , I added 2 tablespoon of unsalted butter -LRB- I love butter -RRB- , and then I did not wait it to be hot , but immediately poured my eggs into pan . In a minute , I started to stir my eggs , added some cheese and salsa , salt and some pepper . I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked . When all moisture disappeared , I moved pan from stove , transferred it to plate .#When did they start to bubble and cook?#after pouring into pan	1

I need to go grocery shopping this weekend so I am in the process of making a shopping list . I 'll look through my fridge , freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly ; coffee , stevia , mint tea bags , paper towels . I 'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant . When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price . I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store . I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for , I will put that on the other side of the paper . Once I have my list made , I 'll double check it and head out to go shopping .#What did they check to see if they already had?#items that they use frequently	1

I ca n't stand clutter in my house , and the garbage in my kitchen was full . I knew I had to take it out right away . I pulled the bag out of the garbage can . A few things fell out as I was doing this , so I picked them up and put them back in the bag . I then had to take it to the dumpster outside so the trash company could come get it . I walked out the door , down my steps , and over to the dumpster . I raised the lid and dropped the bag inside . I made sure the lid was closed before I went back inside so no animals would get into my garbage . When I went back in , I remembered to put a new garbage bag in the can so I could throw more things away without making a huge mess .#What did they tie?#The garbage bag.	1

I usually fold my clothes after I take them out of the dryer . Some people do not , as rumpled casual is OK to wear these days . Folding clothes makes them easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers . If you are going to iron the clothes later , they are less rumpled if you have folded them first . I put them in piles according to clothing type . The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes . I smooth out my socks and put them in pairs , tucking them together at the tops so they stay together . First I lay the item on the bed , smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat , then I fold it into one or two parts . Men 's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage . This is still folding them , as it minimizes the wrinkles . I fold T-shirt , after smoothing them out , by folding the sleeves in first , then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters . Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them . I do n't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes , as my husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear . After I am done folding the clothes I put them away on a shelf in the closet or in drawers .#What do they lay on the bed to fold?#clothing	1

When I was ten my family renovated the kitchen of our house . It was so interesting to watch the builders work . They had many blue prints , that architects had drawn to detail what work had to be done . They also had new cabinets and floors tiles and appliances . They removed some walls while building out others , and laid a new tile floor . They installed all the new cabinets and ran the water pipes and electricity to put in all the new appliances we got . It took them a few weeks to do but when it was done our kitchen was newer and so beautiful . It had better windows and more lights and it was easy to get around and cook in it . Renovating a room can be fun and really give your house a new look .#What did the builders want to make sure was correct?#The blueprint of the kitchen	1

I wanted to throw a Bachelorette Party for my best friend . She lives in Dallas , but she wants to have her party in New Orleans for a girls weekend . The first thing we did was talk about the theme of the party . We decided on the theme of `` Something Blue '' . We would have all colors of blue and activities that have titles with the word blue for the whole weekend . She gave me a list of 20 girls . I created an invitation that had blue and included a picture of her . I also included an itinerary of our weekend activities with all of our fun `` blue '' titles , to set the fun mood . I sealed them before hand writing the addresses and adding a stamp . next , they were off to the post office , so everyone could be invited to our fun weekend .#How many people on the guest list?#all	0

I asked my guest if she would like some iced tea . She replied that she would . I went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . I removed a clean glass from the cabinet . I then added ice from the freezer to the glass . Once I had the glass mostly filled with ice , I poured into the glass enough tea so that the glass was almost full . I took a few packets of sugar from the sugar bowl on the counter . Then I brought out to my guest the glass of tea , the sugar packets , and the spoon . I placed the tea on a coaster before her and set down next to the glass the sugar and teaspoon in case she wanted to sweeten her tea .#What did they remove from the silverware drawer?#sugar packets	0

Saturday is the day I always clean my entire apartment including both of my full bathrooms . To begin cleaning the bathroom I always start with the tub because it is the biggest surface to clean . First I sprayed the bleach cleaner into the tub and then I let it sit for a few minutes . After the tub I sprayed the same solution into the toilet and scrubbed the toilet with the scrubbing brush . I then scrubbed the sink and the faucet until they were shining . Next I sprayed the mirror with Windex and cleaned that until it was as clear as could be . I used my swifter wet jet and sprayed the solution and scrubbed the floor until it was completely clean . Once one bathroom is done I do the exact same process to the second bathroom .#What is scrubbed after a few minutes?#Tub	1

When I was sick coughing last week , my body would n't stop coughing . I felt really sick and so I decided to go to the doctor . When I went to the doctor , they asked me if I was going to have to pay for the visit . I told them that I did , because of my insurance , and so I paid a little bit of money . After a few minutes , my name was called and I visited with my doctor . He stuck a popsicle stick down my throat to see if everything was fine . He said it looked good , so I must be coughing because I 'm a little too thirsty . He also sent me home to get some rest there .#When did they want to get better?#right away	1

I have a poster I like a lot and wanted to put it on my bedroom wall . The first thing I did was clean away the spot on the wall where I thought the poster should go up . Next I cleared away a space on a dining room table so I could lay the poster flat , face down . I peeled away the plastic paper on the back of the tape and attached it to the poster around the outside . Then I peeled away the plastic paper on the other side of the tape . I carried the poster to the wall and took the top two corners of the poster , and placed those where I wanted them to be and pushed them down , making sure the top of the poster looked straight . After this I pressed down the sides of the posters also where the double-sided tape was , and kept the poster tight at the same time . Then I pressed down along the bottom of the poster as well .#What did they use to put the poster up with?#staples	0

I peeled away the plastic paper on the back of the tape and attached it to the poster around the outside . Then I peeled away the plastic paper on the other side of the tape . I carried the poster to the wall and took the top two corners of the poster , and placed those where I wanted them to be and pushed them down , making sure the top of the poster looked straight . After this I pressed down the sides of the posters also where the double-sided tape was , and kept the poster tight at the same time . Then I pressed down along the bottom of the poster as well .#What needed to be put up?#wall paper	0

Last night I wanted to watch my favorite movie . I had the movie on a DVD disk . I got the case the movie came from out of the DVD closet . I opened it up and checked to see if it had any scratches . It did not . I turned on my television . Then I turned the channel to the right output source , using the remote control that goes with my television . I needed to plug in the DVD player . I took the wires from the DVD player , and matched the colors and shapes to the plug ins on the back of the television . Then I plugged the DVD player in . I took the disk I had and put it in the player . I made sure everything was working just right . I enjoyed watching the movie very much .#How did they want to match the plug ins on the back of the television?#matched the colours and shapes of the television	1

When I was 16 , I asked a girl to go on a date with me . I went up to her after class and I asked her if she wanted to go to a concert with me . I think she liked me and she said yes . That night , I went and I picked her up . She got into my car after I opened her door . We drove to the concert and talked about what we liked to do and what we thought about each other . After the concert was over , we went to a ice cream parlor and got some ice cream to share . We laughed at how crazy we were at the concert and decided we should do it again .

It seems like it should be easy to cook rice , but there are lots of different types and knowing how long to soak and then boil it can be tricky . I selected a nice mild basmati rice to cook for dinner . I took out the container and looked at the instructions . I poured two cups of water into the pot and added one cup of rice . I let it soak for 15 minutes , and then I turned on the burner . Once the water started boiling , I covered the pot and reduced the temperature to simmer for ten minutes . I let the rice sit covered for five minutes , and then I fluffed it with a fork . I put it in a bowl to enjoy .#When did their timer go off?#five minutes	0

My friend Joe , who is a construction worker , decided to help me lay tile in my new house the other day . We went into the kitchen and removed all of the old , worn out tile from the floor . We then sanded down the floor and prepared it to receive the new tile . After this , we took a trip to the Home Depot to pick out exactly what new tile I wanted . After buying enough tile to cover the entire floor , we went back to my house . Slowly , tile by tile , we put industrial glue on the bottom of each tile and carefully set it into a neat pattern on the floor . We did this until the entire floor of the kitchen was covered , and then put rubber strips around the outer wall .#What did they let sit and dry?#The new tile floor	1

Everyone had just finished eating a delicious Thanksgiving dinner together as a family . After everyone left the table , my sister and I picked up all the plates and silverware and took them into the kitchen for washing . We worked together to gather all the glasses and put them into the dishwasher . I removed the salt and pepper shakers and put them away while my sister put the butter back into the refrigerator . My sister cleared the tablecloth of crumbs , took it off the table and set it aside to be washed . I sprayed the table with kitchen cleaner and wiped it down with a clean kitchen towel . Together , my sister and I pushed all the chairs back in under the table . Now our table was clean and ready for its next task , the setting of the family UNO game .#What was cleared from the table?#Uno cards	0

We worked together to gather all the glasses and put them into the dishwasher . I removed the salt and pepper shakers and put them away while my sister put the butter back into the refrigerator . My sister cleared the tablecloth of crumbs , took it off the table and set it aside to be washed . I sprayed the table with kitchen cleaner and wiped it down with a clean kitchen towel . Together , my sister and I pushed all the chairs back in under the table . Now our table was clean and ready for its next task , the setting of the family UNO game .#When was the remaining food crumbs cleared from the table?#after the uno game	0

My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish . Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market . When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up . When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones . Some of the fish he buys still has the head , fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too . I like it better when he leaves the scales -LRB- skin -RRB- of the fish as it tastes really good . There are many different ways that he cooks the fish . Sometimes he will fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it . My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi . In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it . My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain .#He bakes the fish in what?#Pan	1

One afternoon I was feeling thirsty and decided to make myself a pot of tea . I grabbed my tea kettle and dumped out all the water that was sitting in there and replaced it with fresh cool water . I placed the full kettle on the stove and turned on the burner to the highest setting to boil the water . I decided to have green tea that day , and scooped about 5 teaspoons of tea into the pot . Once the kettle was steaming , I turned off the stove and let it cool down a little . I poured the water in the pot and replaced the lid of the pot . When the tea was done steeping , I poured myself a cup into a tea cup that I had warmed up with some of the excess hot water . Then I enjoyed my tea when it was cool enough to drink .#When did they stir it?#after dumping out all the water	0

Garbage truck was scheduled for tomorrow . I have big garbage can , and it was kind of full , I wanted it to be out so does not stay in garbage can for another week . I pressed the content more in , so there is some more pace for me to tie the bag . Then I lifted bag upwards , and put it on floor . I sifted it further by knocking the bag to floor , and then grabbed t sides of bag and tied it , Then grabbed remaining 2 sides and tied another knot . I out it aside and then grabbed my fresh bag , opened it with my fingers . I wet my hands and it opened quickly . Then I slide the bag down making sure the sides are fully attached with bag . I put extra portion out of the bag for more protection .#What was tricky to open?#garbage bag	1

Yesterday , I was very hungry , and did n't know what to eat for dinner . There was nothing in the pantry . Then I remembered that we still had spaghetti left from dinner the night before . Perfect ! I would eat spaghetti . I decided I had to heat it in the microwave . First , I put the cold spaghetti in a bowl , and then covered it with plastic wrap , so that it would n't splatter and get the microwave dirty . I put the bowl in the microwave , and set the timer for two minutes . The microwave started and I waited . It felt like forever , because I was so hungry ! When , finally , it finished cooking the spaghetti and beeped , I checked to make sure it was warm . It was ! It was delicious , and I was happy .#When did they take the spaghetti out of the fridge?#After heating it	0

My best friend and I got two tickets to a semi final match at the US Open . We were so excited that we would get to see Venus Williams playing . She was up against Sloan Stewart . We found our seats and got comfortable . The crowd jumped to its feet when the two players walked out holding their raquets . Within a few minutes , Sloan served the ball and Venus easily returned it . So it was tied up in the third . Both players were sweating but they looked like they still had energy . Venus took the first two games and dominated the court .

I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room . The room was in dire need of new wall paper . The old wall paper was looking bad . He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work . I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan . We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls . We checked to make sure everything was even . I did not want uneven wall paper . After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones . We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went . I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh . Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend .#Who did they ask to help them?#susan	0

I did not want uneven wall paper . After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones . We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went . I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh . Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend .#What did they have to brush down?#The wall paper.	1

The walk home in the rain had drenched our clothes . We were sopping wet as we ran into the house laughing . After grabbing towels and bathrobes in exchange for the soggy rags our clothes had become I carried the garments , sopping with water , into the laundry room to dry them in the clothes dryer . First I had to set the temperature of the dryer . A medium temperature seemed like the best idea there . Then I had to choose how long to dry them . Thirty minutes ? Sixty minutes ? With no clue how long it would take I set the timer dial to automatic , surely the dryer would know more about how much time it would take than I would . With everything attended to I closed the door , pressed the start button and we watched through the little circular window as the clothes tumbled around in the machine . After about forty five minutes the buzzer on the dryer sounded and the machine shut itself off . I opened the door to a gust of hot air and lavender scent . One by one I pulled the dry articles of clothing out of the appliance and we put our pants and shirts and socks all back on . A fun night in all , if I do say so myself .#When did they shut the door to the dryer?#after drying	0

I looked around my room and decided that it needed a change . I went to the phone book to look up the name of a service that could help me . There weer many different options and I picked the one that looked like it was the most popular .  He arrived and gave me photos of samples of other rooms he did . I picked some features of the renovated room I wanted and explained how I imagined the rest . The man took my information and began to draw up a set of plans just for me .  The man sent work crews to my house and they worked for a week to renovate my room . I loved the final result and then I paid the man for his services .#What did they review#fabric samples	0

I picked some features of the renovated room I wanted and explained how I imagined the rest . The man took my information and began to draw up a set of plans just for me .  The man sent work crews to my house and they worked for a week to renovate my room . I loved the final result and then I paid the man for his services .#What did they approve#the room renovation plans	1

This morning , I was on my way to work when I noticed that the fuel light was on on the dashboard of the car . I spotted a gas station and pulled in next to one of the pumps - making sure that I remembered to pull in with the fuel door on the car closest to the pump . Before opening my driver side door , I quickly grabbed my bank card and pushed the fuel door button that was located near the bottom of my seat . I looked at the pump and inserted my payment card in the payment slot and then selected the type of gas that my car uses . I then opened the fuel door , took the gas nozzle from the pump and inserted it into the gas tank . The handle had a jumping sensation as an indication that my tank was full and the job was finished . I removed the nozzle from the tank and placed it back on the pump , took my receipt , jumped in my car and headed off to work#Where was the gas flowing?#Into the gas tank.	1

I went to visit the doctor last week because of a sore throat . The first thing I did after getting to the doctor 's office was check in at the main desk . The receptionist asked me my name and input it into her computer . The receptionist asked to see my driver 's license and insurance card , and then asked me to pay my copay , which was $ 15 . I waited , and after a few minutes , a medical assistant called my name so I went with her into the exam room . The assistant measured my height , weight , temperature , heart rate , and blood pressure , and I responded to her questions about why I was there and what medications I take . After inputting the data into a computer she left and I waited in the exam room until the doctor arrived . The doctor then looked into my eyes , ears , and throat with a bright light and felt my glands on my throat and neck . The doctor listened to my heart and my breathing through a stethoscope . After looking at data in the computer , the doctor said that I did not need a prescription , and that I should treat my sore throat with rest , lots of liquids , and an over-the-counter pain and fever reliever . After that , both the doctor and I left the exam room , and I went home and followed the doctor 's advice to rest , drink liquids , and take an over-the-counter pain killer/fever reliever .#After what did the receptionist ask them to take a seat in the waiting room?#before checking in	0

In the town I used to live in , there usually was n't much to do as far as activities go . However , when the local bowling alley opened up , that instantly became a popular spot to hang out . It had just about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar , and they served great food . We would start things off with an actual game of bowling . We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes , followed by getting our lane . While one person set up the game of bowling , the rest of us would go and get the right sized bowling ball that we wanted . I usually always came in last , since I 'm not very good at bowling . After the game of bowling , we 'd go off ad play arcade games and laser tag .#where was a usual trip to?#local bowling alley	1

I decided to get dressed in some nice dress clothes before I went to church . After I was dressed , I took my car keys , got into my car , and drove to church . I entered the church along with plenty of other people who were also attending church that morning . I took out my Bible which I kept in my purse . I read it a little while waiting for the service to begin . The pastor then went to the front of the church and thanked everyone for coming . He asked us to turn to a certain page of our Bibles to read a verse with him , so I turned to the page and read along . I listened intently and felt very moved by his words .

I entered the church along with plenty of other people who were also attending church that morning . I took out my Bible which I kept in my purse . I read it a little while waiting for the service to begin . The pastor then went to the front of the church and thanked everyone for coming . He asked us to turn to a certain page of our Bibles to read a verse with him , so I turned to the page and read along . I listened intently and felt very moved by his words . When the service was over , I thanked him for his work and went home .#What did he began telling them about?#The car	0

It was time for the weekly football game ! But first we had to gear up . Safety was important in a contact sport like football , so we had to put on our uniforms and all of our protective padding . He gave us a pep talk and reminded us how we were supposed to play the first quarter , what plays and strategies we were supposed to use . Then we put our hands in the circle , cheered for ourselves , and started the game . We followed our coach 's playbook , throwing the ball , running defense , tackling the guys on the other team . Sometimes we scored a touchdown and sometimes we did n't . Our team had practiced every day , though , and we knew what we were doing . Our coach kept up the pep talks and advice through each quarter of the game as we swapped out tired players for new ones and kept running across the field and scoring goals . It was a great football game !#What did they grab before circling around the coach?#their gear	1

Every morning I take a bath . Before I get into the bath tub , I turn on the water . I adjust the cold and the hot water to make a bearable temperature . After the water is just right , I take off all my clothes and enter the tub . I pour water on my body then I lather up with either soap or shower gel . Once I have soap all over my body , I take my loofah sponge and pour soap on that as well . I do this to ensure that all the dirt washes off my skin . While I am scrubbing my body , I like to sing in the shower . After I scrub really good and finish singing , I pour water continuously on my body until all the soap washes off .#What do they stay in until they feel clean?#The bath tub	1

The seats were oily and the floor was sticky . The cushions smelled of butter that was fake . It was dim , but the there was excitement in the air . Tension was high , and hopes were through the roof that this would be a decent showing . I turned to my friend and smiled , and the lights cut out . The projector clicked on , and the first titles showed on the screen . The movie had begun to play . What ensued next was a cavalcade of ridiculous excitement . Cliches , poor acting , and abysmal dialogue played out across 90 minutes of cinematic excrement , and we loved every minute of it . By the time the movie had ended , we were all beaming with happiness at our night .#What came from the crowd?#happiness	1

Last night , I threw pizza into the trash can and some plates and I realized that the bag was starting to get full . I tried to fit some more in but upon realizing that I could n't , I decided to replace the bag . I pulled out the garbage bag current bag , while trying not to spill any of the trash on the floor and had a new bag prepared . Upon tying the bag , I took it outside and placed it on the front lawn , where the trash people always pick it up . I then pushed the new trash bag down so that I knew that I could fit any new trash into the bag and I then stopped . This experience was regular and easy and was influenced by the same routine that I always follow weekly .#What did they put in the trash can before they tied the old trash?#A new bag	0

Upon tying the bag , I took it outside and placed it on the front lawn , where the trash people always pick it up . I then pushed the new trash bag down so that I knew that I could fit any new trash into the bag and I then stopped . This experience was regular and easy and was influenced by the same routine that I always follow weekly .#When did they tie the old trash?#When in the trash can	0

My husband and I recently bought a house . First we had to go to the bank to get a loan . The bank checked our credit history and gave us the loan .  Next , we looked for a house .  We also looked for neighborhoods in good school districts , and near a park and grocery store . We found a nice house for sale in a neighborhood we liked . It has three bedrooms and is in good shape .  She showed us the inside of the house , and we really liked it . We then put in an application for the house , and waited to hear back from the real estate agent . A few weeks later , she called us and told us we got the house .  We will move in soon .#When did they go to the neighborhoods to look for a house?#After the bank approved their loan	1

Yesterday afternoon I got my new bank statement , so I balanced my checkbook immediately . First , I gathered up all my receipts and my check register . Then I got a calculator and a pen . When I finished with that , I checked other transactions such as checks I ’d written against the statement . While this time I had n’t forgotten to enter any transactions , if I had , I would add those to my check register and adjust my balance . Once I was sure that the entries in my check register are complete , I checked my balance again . If it does n’t match the statement , I look for outstanding transactions such as checks that have n’t cleared . Once I subtracted the outstanding checks , my account balanced , so I put my receipts in the envelope with my bank statement and filed it in my business files .#What do they check off against the charges on the statement?#Business files	0

For my anniversary with my husband , I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast . One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice . I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part !#When did they plug the juicer in?#after squeezing oranges	0

I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part !#What did they slice?#Carrot	0

Now I am going to set the dining table up for dinner . First I put away all the stuff that is not supposed to be on the table . Next I clean the table with a tissue paper . Then I arrange some of the decorations on the table . After that I put down the plates and glasses.lastly in the remaining spaces on the table I put down what we are going to eat but I do n't put down dessert yet . I call my family down for dinner . I swept a drop of sweat of my chin and forehead . It was hard hard work but still it was so much fun . Oh no my family is done with dinner and now I have to bring them dessert which is fruit I made myself .#What is left to do?#Call the family for dinner	0

I looked up directions to the concert venue on my computer before leaving and printed the directions on my printer . I made sure I had my concert ticket in my wallet . I locked up my house and got into the car . Once I arrived , I located a parking space and parked the car . There was a charge for the parking spot , so I paid the parking lot attendant . He gave me a colored ticket in exchange and I placed this ticket inside my car on the dash where it was clearly visible from the outside of the car . I gave the event staffer my ticket , which she punched and returned to me . I entered the performance hall and located my seat . Once I located my seat , I sat down and made sure to set my phone on silent .#How were they able to get to the venue?#train	0

Me and my nephews went into the pool and started moving into it while we waited for their swimming instructor . First we did some freestyle , and after a few minutes it transformed into a funny " dog style " , just paddling with our arms and legs like dogs do when they swim . When the instructor came , he greeted the children . All of them stood on one edge of the pool when I swam to the side just to give all of them space to train . He made a circle with his arms and told the children to jump through it head first into the water , with arms stretching forward and touching each other . He made all children repeat the diving until he thought everyone got it decently right , since there was age variety among the 12 students , ages 5 to 15 . The diving practice took some 15 minutes . I told him I only knew butterfly stroke from Wikipedia so I would be more than happy to give it a try . He gave me some instructions about how to make the stroke better , and it took another 45 minutes to help the children practice theirs . After one hour had passed , we got out of the pool , the teacher said goodbye to everyone and we all gave him our payment for the hour of class .#Who did he start teaching?#the instructor	0

First we did some freestyle , and after a few minutes it transformed into a funny " dog style " , just paddling with our arms and legs like dogs do when they swim . When the instructor came , he greeted the children . All of them stood on one edge of the pool when I swam to the side just to give all of them space to train . He made a circle with his arms and told the children to jump through it head first into the water , with arms stretching forward and touching each other . He made all children repeat the diving until he thought everyone got it decently right , since there was age variety among the 12 students , ages 5 to 15 . The diving practice took some 15 minutes . I told him I only knew butterfly stroke from Wikipedia so I would be more than happy to give it a try . He gave me some instructions about how to make the stroke better , and it took another 45 minutes to help the children practice theirs .

I got the best present yesterday ! My little boy painted me a picture of him and me next to a rainbow . He did a really great job on the painting and he was very proud of his master piece . He and I walked around the house with the painting and looked for the perfect spot . We looked in the living room , the kitchen , the playroom , and even the bathroom . We finally decided it would look best in my bedroom . That way I could always see it and it would be with me . We took the painting , a nail , a hammer and a tape measure and headed into my room to hang it up . I put the nail in a little and let my little boy hammer it is , too . We hung the painting on the nail and it was the perfect touch that my room needed .#What kind of spot was chosen?#the living room	0

Sometimes I let my cleaning get out of hand . I do n't like to cook . I try to do as little of it as possible and only refrigerate .  I do not have many dishes .  I am getting better about it . I found out that eggs are a really bad one to leave out . I left egg remnants out on the counter .  Three days later I had maggots , which was gross , but it happened quicker than I would have expected .  I ran out of detergent recently .  That means I had a film of cocoa from soaking a dish that stayed in my kitchen sink for a couple days .  I was still glad to be able to clean that up . It only takes a minute to wipe the counters , which helps too .#When did they attract bugs?#after they cleaned everything	0

At 2:00 in the afternoon , I realized I had n't eaten lunch yet . I remembered I had some leftover pasta from dinner out two nights ago . I went to the refrigerator and pulled it out . I covered it with plastic wrap and walked over to the microwave . I estimated it would take about two minutes to heat up , so I set the timer to that . I put it in , shut the door and hit the start button . After about a minute I opened the microwave , took the bowl out , removed the plastic wrap and stirred my pasta . After the beeper went off , I took the bowl out , closed the door , took the plastic off and enjoyed my left over pasta .#When did they put the pasta back in the microwave?#After they ate it	0

At 2:00 in the afternoon , I realized I had n't eaten lunch yet . I remembered I had some leftover pasta from dinner out two nights ago . I went to the refrigerator and pulled it out . I covered it with plastic wrap and walked over to the microwave . I estimated it would take about two minutes to heat up , so I set the timer to that .

This morning I decided to clean our bathroom shower in our house . I knew it should only take about fifteen minutes so I got started right away . I gathered together a cleaning sponge , a shower cleaning spray , a rinse cup , and a towel to dry my hands . Next I sprayed the shower with a shower cleaner . I allowed this to stay on the walls about five minutes . Then I took a wet sponge and began rubbing the tub and shower walls with a circular motion . I used this to wash off all the soap from the walls . I checked to make sure I did n't miss any spots . I placed the shampoo , soap , and razors back into their spots . I dried my hands , and I was done .#In addition to bottles and razors, what else did they remove from the shower?#faucet	0

I go to the gym about twice a week . I went to the gym this morning , and it was a great time . When I go to the gym , I like to do the elliptical . While running on the elliptical , I put my favorite show on so I can watch it . I watch one entire episode and do n't stop running until it 's over . It 's a great way to motivate myself to stay at the gym ! I like to lift weights one day a week , and the other two days is dedicated entirely to cardio . Running is my favorite gym activity because it gives me time to myself and to think . Lifting weights is fun too , but it takes more effort for me to lift weights .#Where did the person go?#favorite show	0

I have been promising my girls a pet cat but kept putting it off . I had n't been feeling well and I felt I had enough to work on around my house to worry about a pet . Unfortunately I I had been having a lot of issues with mice . My husband bought a few traps and set them up once , but would n't follow through with emptying them and resetting them , or figureing out how to stop from coming in in the first place . After I spent hours cleaning out nests I found inside my couches , I gave up and decided having a cat would be fare less work than dealing with this mess and hopefully might help with the mice issue . We liked her , and she seemed to like us . She had been fixed and had a chip . We filled out some paperwork and paid some fees , and took her home .#What did they find at the humane society?#mice	0

Last week , my boyfriend and I went on a date . First , we went out to dinner at a local restaurant . It was a new Indian cuisine place called `` Lazy Garden . '' He had a few kebabs and I had an Indian and Asian fusion salad . After finishing dinner , we went to a movie . We saw a special showing of older movies on modern screens . We saw `` Jaws , '' and it was very interesting to see a movie that came out before we were both born on the big screen . We both jumped when the Jaws jumped out of the water as we nibbled on our Goobers and Sour Patch Kids . When the movie was over , we drove to a local park and just talked as we stared up at the stars .#When did the romantic evening end?#After they stargazed at the park.	1

Last week , my boyfriend and I went on a date . First , we went out to dinner at a local restaurant . It was a new Indian cuisine place called `` Lazy Garden . '' He had a few kebabs and I had an Indian and Asian fusion salad . After finishing dinner , we went to a movie . We saw a special showing of older movies on modern screens . We saw `` Jaws , '' and it was very interesting to see a movie that came out before we were both born on the big screen .

I like to make clothes on my sewing machine . I can choose exactly which fabrics to use and exactly what design I want them to be . I can also make them to fit me perfectly . I decided to make a dress . When I got home , I opened the pattern and spread out all the pattern pages . Each page has patterns for different pieces of the dress in different sizes . They are all printed over each other . I looked on the instructions to work out which size I wanted to make the dress , and found which color of line I needed to cut along . I cut out all the pieces . There was a front and a back piece , a sleeve pattern , which I needed to cut two of , and a collar . Then I cut around the paper pattern and through the fabric to get the fabric pieces the right shape . Then I pinned the pieces together with the front of the fabric on the inside . I sewed along each edge with my sewing machine . Then I sewed the sleeve seam , and then sewed the sleeve to the dress . Finally I sewed the collar to the neckline of the dress . All of that was done with the inside of the fabric facing out , so the seams would end up on the inside when I turned it right-side out . So finally I turned it right side out , all the seams ended up on the inside , and I had a new dress to wear .#Where did they buy the fabric?#Fabric store	1

Last weekend , my friend and I worked in the garden . The weather was nice and sunny outside , so we decided it would be the perfect day to spend time outdoors in our backyard garden . Our garden has a lot of flowers in it , but we thought it would be fun to plant some vegetables as well . We went to the store and picked up some supplies that we would need , like a small shovel , a small watering can , and some vegetable seeds -LRB- including carrot seeds , tomato seeds , and cucumber seeds -RRB- . We then went to our backyard and started to dig small holes in the soil so that we would have space to plant our seeds . Then we filled the watering can and watered each small mound of soil that had seeds underneath . All in all , working in the garden was a great way to spend the afternoon .#What did they drop into the small holes?#seeds	1

I walked down the stairs in search of some medicine for my mother . I did not want to her to get sick so I was in a hurry . I opened my drawer and grabbed her medicine for her cold . I opened the bottle and grabbed one pill . I then ran up the stairs . My mother was on the bed and was waiting for me . I gave her the pill . She was about to take the pill but then she stopped when she thought about me . She told me to take care of herself so that I would not end up like her someday .

Last week , I played a game of tennis with my grandfather . Before beginning to play , I grabbed rackets from the closet and a bucket of balls . I put them in the living room and grabbed water s that I could have some while I played . After doing this , I walked to the tennis court with my grandfather and started to play . We first just hit the ball around , then practiced serving , and finally played a game . We gave each other advice and tried to play as serious as best as we could . It was a fun experience and we both felt that we were getting a good workout , while also playing the sport well . Once we played a real game , we served the ball hard at each other and attempted to win the game .#What was it about?#Playing basketball	0

I put them in the living room and grabbed water s that I could have some while I played . After doing this , I walked to the tennis court with my grandfather and started to play . We first just hit the ball around , then practiced serving , and finally played a game . We gave each other advice and tried to play as serious as best as we could . It was a fun experience and we both felt that we were getting a good workout , while also playing the sport well .

I sat in the classroom and waited for the teacher to had out the blank exam papers . I did n't know exactly what would be on the exam , but I had studied for a few days from the chapters that we had been reading in class that semester . The teacher handed me my exam .

When I have some free time , I start selecting clothes from my pile of clean laundry . Which shirts need ironed ? Are there pants that are super wrinkly ? I will select one article of clothing to iron first . I set up my ironing board , and plug in the iron . I always make sure the settings are how I need them , and I place the iron upright so that it does not burn the board . I wait a minute or so , and then lay my first shirt or pants on the ironing board . I will take the iron and smooth out the shirt carefully , but deliberately . I am always careful to not leave the iron on too long so it does not burn . Some steam is OK .#Where have things been taken out of?#From the pile of clean laundry	1

One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis . When I play tennis , a friend and I go to a special place called a court , which is made just for playing tennis . The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle .  To play tennis , we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets .  If you do n't hit the ball back when it 's hit to you , or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court , you score points .  When you score once , you get fifteen points . When you score again , you get another fifteen points , so you have 30 points . Score a third time , you get 10 points , giving you a total of 40 .#When do they get 40 points#when the ball goes outside the court	0

If you do n't hit the ball back when it 's hit to you , or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court , you score points .  When you score once , you get fifteen points . When you score again , you get another fifteen points , so you have 30 points . Score a third time , you get 10 points , giving you a total of 40 .#When is scoring in tennis very different than in other sports?#they get multiple points at once	1

Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis . Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people , sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs . There is a low net between both people playing the game . Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores . The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set . We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired , then we came home . It was really a good workout for the both of us and we would like to take you to watch and play the next time we decide to play tennis .#They used what to hit the ball?#Tennis rackets.	1

I had n't gone for a hair cut in about 7 weeks so I was certainly due . The hair around the side of my head was starting to grow over my ears . I generally go the same hairdresser and ask for the same person , Sue who is very good at her job and is quite pleasant . When I arrived the place was rather full with customers , seemingly more woman than men . Several people were covered with the big hair drying bag over their head which makes me giggle . I was told to go right in the back where the men 's area is located and sat down for my hair cut . After having my hair washed by a helper I was soon seated at Sue 's chair and enjoyed our usual small talk while she cut my hair . We discussed recent weekend getaways and holiday family gatherings .#Who did they tip when she was done?#the helper	0

Last night , after finishing up the laundry for the week , I was dead tired and ready for bed . Unfortunately , I had removed the bed sheets from the bed to launder them . I had taken off the fitted sheet and the pillowcases and tossed them into the washer . So , I went to my closet and took out another bed sheet and pillow case set . I unfurled the fitted sheet and managed to get it around all four corners . I then took the pillowcases and put them on my two pillows . After finishing the bed sheet change , I passed out on my soft , comfortable , and now , clean bed for a night of sleep . Tomorrow morning , I will take out the drying sheets and pillowcase from the dryer , fold them and then put them in the closet that I got tonight 's new sheets from . Sleepy time .#When did they work on the bed sheets?#Last night before bed	1
